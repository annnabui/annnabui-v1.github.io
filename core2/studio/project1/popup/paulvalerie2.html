        Paul Valéry also described his perception of first lines so vividly, and to my mind so accurately, that I have never forgotten it: the opening line of a poem, he said, is like <a href="https://annnabui.github.io/core2/studio/project1/popup/fruit.html">finding a fruit on the ground</a>, a piece of fallen fruit you have never seen before, and the poet's task is to create the tree from which such a fruit would fall.
