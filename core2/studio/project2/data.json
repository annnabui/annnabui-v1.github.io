The book adds another layer to the approach proposed by the curatorship. Gathered by a deep research in the country's main archives (Biblioteca Nacional, Arquivo Nacional and Arquivo Histórico do Itamaraty), some two hundred historical files accompany unpublished literary texts by contemporary authors. \n\nInterposed to the documents, the texts reconfigure the supposedly official Brazilian narrative, allowing us to see historical figures and moments often erased in the hegemonic national imaginary. Like the exhibition itself, the design of the publication makes reference to fanzines and the aesthetics of protest posters and street lambe-lambes, in compositions superimposed with historical scenes, coats of arms and flags.\n\nA huge thanks to @erikapalomino for the invitation and enlightenment (as always), @travassosju for the outstanding organisation and @amandalianza for the onpoint graphic coordination. Also thanks to the curators @bzlemos Kenya Eleison, Pablo Lafuente e @thiago.paulasouza for the trust.",
