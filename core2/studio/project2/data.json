Ok… 😢 \n\nANYWAY\n\nThoracic rotation is an essential movement for sporting endeavors like tennis, golf, or boxing. It is also essential for daily tasks like picking up heavy things next to you.\n\nWhen you lack thoracic rotation, rotation needs to stem from other areas in the kinetic chain, and we can avoid these compensations if we increase mobility through the spine.\n\nTaking measures like bracing an object against a wall will ensure you are isolating the thoracic spine, without letting the hips externally rotate. Give these a shot before you’re next upper body workout 👍🏼 \n#mobility #posture #spinalhealth #posturecorrection #athletictraining #mobilitytraining",
