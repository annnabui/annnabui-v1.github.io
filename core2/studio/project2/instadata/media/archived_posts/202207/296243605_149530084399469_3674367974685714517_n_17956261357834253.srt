00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,462
This was just my political
economies class finals. Um like

2
00:00:05,462 --> 00:00:08,262
what I wrote for the final but
it sounded good so I have to

3
00:00:08,262 --> 00:00:12,462
share. Sorry. Um I was just
talking about austerity and

4
00:00:12,462 --> 00:00:17,302
examples of successful
implementations of of austerity

5
00:00:17,302 --> 00:00:26,722
in the western kind of economic
sphere. Let's go. Um austerity

6
00:00:26,722 --> 00:00:29,922
was initially a project coined
by the capitalist state and

7
00:00:29,922 --> 00:00:33,442
economist to foreclose all
demands for an alternative

8
00:00:33,442 --> 00:00:37,042
society after World War one.
However, it's everlasting

9
00:00:37,042 --> 00:00:40,722
ability to restabolize capital
accumulation inspired many

10
00:00:40,722 --> 00:00:43,682
countries down the passing of
time to follow in the footsteps

11
00:00:43,682 --> 00:00:47,442
of their European predecessors.
Two examples of successful

12
00:00:47,442 --> 00:00:51,842
austerity implementations are
Italy under Bonito Mussolini's

13
00:00:51,842 --> 00:00:55,722
fascist regime and Chile under
Augusto Pinosha's military

14
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:59,462
dictatorship. Though these two
cases were from unrelated parts

15
00:00:59,462 --> 00:01:01,999
of the world.
