Its leaders helped form the Amherstburg Baptist Association and the Canadian Anti-Slavery Baptist Association, both of which supported abolitionism. These organizations aided, both spiritually and materially, the ever-increasing number of fugitive slaves fleeing north.",
                "Additional_Info_3": "The church's activism was not limited to slavery, however. In 1843 and in 1865, it hosted a \"State Conventionof Colored Citizens\" to petition the Michigan government for Negro Suffrage, and after the Civil War, the church played a vital role in helping thousands of migrating freed slaves in securing homes and jobs in and around Detroit. The church assisted more than 5,000 slaves on their way to Canada.",
