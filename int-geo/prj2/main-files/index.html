    <h1>Underground Railroad</h1>
    <h3>Short summary of the underground railroad here</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Started out because the metaphor of railroad people used to call this grassroot effort towards abolition of slavery in the united states. Reminds me of the materials I read in Nicole Starosielski's The Undersea Network. In my first project of this series, I made a map with leaflet.js that shows the Underground Railroad locations in Detroit, Michigan. I noticed that many of the sites are religious or religious-affiliated, which piqued my interest. I highlighted those sites wonder, why are churches and cemeteries such a big part of Underground Railroad efforts in Detroit? Is it the same in other regions of the US?</p>

    <p>I found a large dataset with all Underground Railroad locations from the National Park Service's <a href="https://www.nps.gov/subjects/undergroundrailroad/about-the-network-to-freedom.htm">Network to Freedom Project</a>. I cleaned and mapped this data set using Datawrapper to see the percentage of religious and religious-affiliated sites in the Underground Railroad in all of the US to see if my suspicion was correct.</p>

    <br>
    <p>More than half of categorized sites are churches or cemeteries. I was curious to why, and found out that was because the Quakers, [explain], were deeply involved in the organization and operation of the Underground Railroad</p>

    <p>To understand why or how the Quakers were involved, below is a short timeline that recaps major events of the Underground Railroad.</p>

                <em>The earliest representation of the Underground Railroad as an actual train appears, in an abolitionist newspaper in Illinois, the Western Citizen.

    <p>I also made a chart to illustrate the connection between major figures of the Underground Railroad to illustrate the complexity and strength of this grassroot movement.</p>

    <p>Obviously these are just people who are written down in history, there are so many martyrs and maroon community leaders who went unnoticed due to oppression. I hope to continue my research and visualization work in this direction to give the stage back to people who were most affected by racism and oppresion.</p>
