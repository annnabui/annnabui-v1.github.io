On January 3, 1861, Georgia State troops took possession of the federal fort with orders from the governor to ""hold it against all persons."" On April 10, 1862, Union forces, under the command of Major General David Hunter, demanded the unconditional surrender of the fort. Confederate Colonel Charles H. Olmstead refused the demand, and the two sides soon began exchanging cannon fire. After 30 hours of battle, the Union forces prevailed and took possession of the fort. After the victory, Gen. Hunter announced in General Order No. 7, that: ""All persons of color lately held to involuntary service by enemies of the United States in Fort Pulaski and on Cockspur Island, Georgia, are hereby confiscated and declared free, in conformity with the law, and shall here after receive the fruits of their own labor."" This order was issued approximately eight months before Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation. Until the end of the Civil War, Fort Pulaski served as a destination for enslaved people attempting to reach freedom. It also played an important role as a recruitment station for freed African American males who wanted to serve in one of the nation's first black regiments, the First South Carolina Volunteer Infantry."

The ferry crossing was on the main state/post road between Des Moines [east] and Kanesville (Council Bluffs) [west]. This portion of the road was on the Jim Lane Trail and the Tabor to Springdale route of the Underground Railroad across Iowa. It was the only way to cross the river for many miles in both directions. One noteworthy incident occurred in February 1859, as John Brown, with the help of others, transported a dozen freedom seekers across the ferry. The river crossing is an appropriate place to commemorate this association with the Underground Railroad in Southwestern Iowa. Today, the Nishnabotna Ferry House property is owned by a local historical association. It is located across the river, approximately a quarter mile east of the George B. Hitchcock House. The ferry keeper's house is the only remaining structure from the period."

Initially settling in Shaweentown, Roots soon relocated to a 1200-acre farm south of Tamaroa, where he built a five-room log cabin, began Locust Hill Academy, and, according to family tradition, began aiding runaway slaves. The current 12-room mansion was built along the Shawneetown to St. Louis trail between 1854 and 1856. Benajah G. Roots' documented involvement in Underground Railroad activity stems from his physical and protracted intervention in the case of freedom-seeker Jim Gray in October 1859, as Roots sought through legal redress to prevent Gray's kidnapping by slave catchers. Roots presented testimony regarding the Gray incident as a defense witness in the Chicago trial of John Hossack in February 1860. B. G. Roots' participation in the Gray incident tends to lend credence to oft repeated family tradition that Roots was active in the Underground Railroad and that his Locust Hill property served as a station (both the original log-cabin, no longer extant, the 1850s mansion), and as a small post-Emancipation settlement and burial ground for former freedom seekers. Unfortunately, extensive twentieth century alterations to the property's landscape, buildings and structures have destroyed these purported hiding places and habitations."

IFT members dedicate themselves and their resources to the research, education, interpretation, and reverence of Indiana's UGRR heritage for the benefit of future generations. The group includes representatives of state agencies, historical societies, and libraries, along with private individuals; all of whom are volunteers. Volunteers work within their regions to research the sites in their area, then the group places these regional sites into statewide context and how the sites and individuals are related. The group is beginning to work with researchers in other states to connect Indiana's sites with other state's sites."

Floyd County is in a very unique spot in that it stretches thirteen miles along the Ohio River across from Louisville, Kentucky. There were, therefore, border problems and ensuing complications for slaves who attempted to cross the river through this metropolitan area. Slave catchers and police worked together and easily crossed the river using the ferry and railroad systems. Therefore, escape through this area was very difficult. Newspapers frequently reported on capture of runaway slaves in this southern Indiana region. This program conveys the problems but also gives documented examples of slaves who were able to escape through Floyd County on their own as well as with the help of local citizens. The free African American community was primarily responsible for assistance, but help also came from white, anti-slavery church members.

The program also emphasizes the fact that the Underground Railroad was still in operation in this area after President Lincoln gave the Emancipation Proclamation. Because Kentucky was a Union state, the proclamation did not apply to Kentucky slaves. Many slaves ignored that fact, however. Between January 1, 1863, and the end of the Civil War, Floyd County was flooded with fugitives from slavery. The Indiana Exclusion Act of 1851 was not rescinded until 1866. That coupled with the fact that bias against blacks continued to exist, meant that benevolent activity of any kind toward runaway slaves and contraband families had to be suppressed. The program manager makes use of overhead transparencies and shares her extensive research of census records, church and court records, newspapers and oral histories."

The house is documented to have housed at least one other fugitive slave and is purported to have been a haven for many others. Douglass' intellect and temperament surely inclined him toward anti-slavery work, but Nathan Johnson and New Bedford provided him an example and opportunity to grow into one of the most effective and renowned abolitionists of his time. Frederick Douglass was Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey and had begun to use the surname, Johnson when he arrived in New Bedford in September of 1838 and Nathan Johnson persuaded him to choose a less common name.

Rev. Beckley lectured as a commissioned agent of the American Anti-Slavery Society in New England, moved to Michigan in 1839 and immediately resumed his anti-slavery activities. A member of the Michigan Anti-Slavery Society Executive Committee from 1840, Beckley served as Vice-President in 1845. From 1841-1847 Beckley co-published the anti-slavery newspaper and national Liberty Party voice, Signal of Liberty. Biographical slave accounts offered justification for Northerners to assist runaways. In addition to articles arousing abolitionist sympathy, Beckley wrote about assisting slaves. Conductor Lyman Goodnow's account mentions stopping at Beckley's along the Wisconsin to Canada journey with runaway Caroline Quarlls. Other reminiscences and stories identify Guy Beckley, stationmaster.

It stands on its original site at the highest point in the Town of Nolney, on the north side of State Route 3, three miles east of Fulton, New York. Except for the loss of its bell, the church is in virtually original condition. The Oswego County landfill encroaches 200 feet to the rear of the church, but otherwise the surrounding countryside retains its rural character. Many of the area's farmhouses were associated with church members and church activities.

This church is significant architecturally because it represents a simple, functional, and unostentatious Federal form common to many upstate congregations influenced by New England traditions. The pattern reflects the congregation's rural lifestyle and their commitment to traditional values, including ideals of Calvinism and republican virtue. The building also reflects the congregation's relatively modest means and suggests that they defined wealth in spiritual rather than material terms.

The Bristol Hill Church illustrates the history of the underground railroad, abolitionism, and African American life in central New York in three important ways:

1. First, at least two families in this church participated in well-documented underground railroad activities. One family, that of Hiram and Lucy Gilbert, was European American. One family, that of Amos and Hannah Mason, was African American.

2. From the 1820's on, this church had African American as well as European American members. Hannah Mason apparently became a member shortly after she migrated to Oswego County in 1825. Two daughters of Amos and Hannah Mason were baptized in this church in 1827. Amos Mason and James Watkins Seward joined in 1831. Isaac and Sally Lawson joined in 1832.

The site has been termed ""the Grand Central Station of the Underground Railroad"" because of the number of African Americans who passed through Peterboro with help from Smith and his family. The estate was located at the junction of several Underground Railroad routes through central New York. From Peterboro, the well-traveled paths ran into Canada via Lewiston, Rochester, Sodus Point, Fairhaven, Oswego and Cape Vincent. According to primary documents, Smith's barn and kitchen were often used to house refugees.

In addition to Underground Railroad activities, Smith was a radical activist who made speeches, wrote essays, and donated money in the name of abolition. He led the New York Anti-Slavery Society in the 1830's, and eventually ran for state and national office on abolitionist tickets from 1840-1860. Smith used his wealth to purchase the freedom of enslaved African Americans and entertained numerous abolitionists who came to the estate to discuss pressing issues and plan political action. Some of those freed by Smith eventually worked for him at his estate."

This alliance supported not only Littlefield's business activities but also his involvement with abolitionism and the Freedom Trail.

Documentation for the use of Littlefield's house as a way station comes from three sources: a letter from Edwards to Smith; and oral tradition collected in the early 20th century and delivered in a DAR speech; and an oral tradition passed through the family of the minister of Edwards' church. Because Edwards' letter is a primary source, written by a person directly involved at the time of the events, the documentation for the Littlefield House as an Underground Railroad site is excellent. Though some exterior changes are evident, the house retains integrity of location, setting, feeling and association."

For at least sixteen of those years he was a key helper on the Freedom Trail, arranging passage across Lake Ontario for fugitive slaves on the very least part of their journey to Canada. Documentation for use of the Edwards' house as a stop on the Underground Railroad is remarkable, both for its detail and for the long time span it covers. The original Edwards letters to Smith which relate these underground activities are located in Bird Library, Syracuse University.

Edwards purchased the house in 1836, two years after it was built, and owned it until his death in 1895. Greek Revival in style, the two-story building exhibits a gable end orientation to the street, post and beam construction, and a foundation of cut field stone. The modillions beneath the eaves are seen rarely in Oswego County. Before the Civil War, at the time of its greatest historic significance, the house was surrounded by open fields. After the war Edwards sold the adjoining parcels of Lot 108, Block 139; today the Edwards House sets on a 33' wide lot, surrounded by homes situated on similar small plots.

Fortunately, the John B. and Lydia Edwards House retains its original form on its original site, and a feeling and association related to its historic period. Were they to return today, the Edwards family would surely recognize the house as their own?"

Everything that contributed to the Resistance Movement of the enslaved who left Texas and sought refuge in Mexico between 1821 and 1865 is the subject of our investigation and dialogue. This process includes selecting a community where slavery was dominant, namely East Texas. We contact local historians and Convention and Visitors Bureaus to make inroads to the general public, educational institutions, businesses, and heritage organizations, i.e., County Historical Commissions. The program then takes several forms: presentations at area schools and colleges, community historic tours, family history workshop, a day-long general session, a cooperative exhibit, and a community recognition dinner."

It was a public forum as well as a courthouse. Slaves were auctioned from its steps in estate settlements, while one man's suit for freedom helped plunge the country into Civil War. In the lower west courtroom one of the most important cases ever tried in the United States began. In 1847 and again in 1850, a slave named Dred Scott and his wife Harriet sued for, and were granted, their freedom. Appeals to higher courts by their owner took their freedom away, and led to the momentous Supreme Court decision of 1857, which upheld the ruling that they should remain slaves, and declared the Missouri Compromise of 1820 unconstitutional. The Dred Scott Decision hastened the start of the Civil War. It is also the most famous of thousands of civil suits launched by slaves throughout the United States in the antebellum period to try to gain their freedom through the action of the courts. As such it represents another avenue toward freedom for slaves other than manumission or flight. The Old Courthouse stands only two blocks from the Gateway Arch and contains restored courtrooms, museum exhibits on the Dred Scott Decision, historical dioramas, and the headquarters of Jefferson National Expansion Memorial. Ranger-led tours are available at scheduled times, as are public programs on civil rights and slavery. Mock trials highlight the struggles of Dred and Harriet Scott for their freedom as well as lesser-known cases like that of Lucy Delaney, a 12 year old girl who sued for her freedom three years before the Scotts, or Caroline Williams, who challenged St. Louis' segregation policies on public transportation in 1869."

The Johnson brothers built the Furnace and Manor House in the late 1770's and began making iron in 1776. At that time, the Johnson brothers -- James, Thomas, Roger, and Baker, were the largest owners of enslaved persons in Frederick County, MD, and employed both additional enslaved labor and freemen as necessary to fill production orders. There is evidence of enslaved labor until at least 1848, and several of these workers were buried in a graveyard that was relocated due to construction of US Rt. 15 in the early 1970s. Period newspaper advertisements provide evidence of at least one freedom seeker in 1780, and of a kidnapping of a freeman's son by a Caucasian man in the 1800's. After the Johnsons retired from the iron industry, the Catoctin Iron Furnace went through several owners and technological changes and continued to operate until 1903.

In recognition of his importance, the Penna. Historical and Museum Commission placed an historical marker in front of his residence at 123 E. Philadelphia Street in York.

Also, Goodridge reportedly transported William Parker and his compatriots after their resistance of the slave master in Christiana in 1851.

Richard Bland Lee, an uncle of Robert E. Lee, lived at Sully from 1794-1811 with his wife Elizabeth Collins Lee, their children and wards, and up to 40 enslaved African Americans. Mr. Lee inherited 1500 acres of land and 29 bondsmen upon the death of his father, Henry Lee II in 1787. He sold half the land and kept approximately 777 acres for use as a farm. Crops grown at Sully included wheat, corn, timothy, and clover. Of the nearly 40 enslaved African Americans, approximately 80% were field workers, while 20% were house servants. During the Lees' occupancy of Sully, there are four known incidents of escapes. These incidents are documented through Lee letters and run-away advertisements. In one case, Beaver Ludwell did return to Sully, accompanied by his wife Nancy. When the Lees left Sully in 1811, many of the bondsmen were sold as part of the property. Others accompanied the Lees to their new home in Alexandria."

Beginning with legislation enacted in February 1837 by the Senate and House of Representatives that set forth penalties for those caught assisting the escape of enslaved people, to the arrest and trial of Samuel Burris ten years later, to the refusal of the Governor to intervene in the case despite the pleas of noted abolitionists, the State House provided the backdrop for an incredible story of steadfast allegiance. Samuel Burris' jail cell was a scant 100 yards from the State House. The steps of the historic building then provided the setting for the dramatic moment when the law was played out, resulting in the auction of Burris into servitude, according to the 1837 statute.

The tours give a human face to those who worked individually and collectively to escape slavery. The carefully researched tour sites are presented by professional guides with a hope that visitors will have a more comprehensive understanding of the role of Washtenaw County citizens in opposing slavery and emancipating enslaved African Americans.

This network was developed in North Carolina by African-American watermen who were able to arrange passage to northern states for fugitive slaves through their knowledge and expertise in maritime activities. One well-documented example is Harriet Jacob's account of her 1842 escape from Edenton by ship. Her escape was arranged by a waterman named Peter. Jacobs describes in ""Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, Written by Herself"", the arrangements Peter made in advance, how plans to transport her to a waiting ship were carried out, her fear of being found out, and her thankfulness when disembarking in Philadelphia that her friend Peter had correctly judged the ship captain's character. This example is not only of one individual's escape to freedom, but also of the network that existed making that escape possible. Jacobs' autobiography was published in 1861 with names and places changed. In 1987, the actual names of characters were authenticated and found to have been residents of Edenton, NC."

In the early 1820’s, enslaved Africans, runaways and Black Seminoles sought freedom on Key Biscayne. They met with the captains of small ships (known as ""sloops"") from the British Bahamas who offered transportation across the gulf stream. In 1821, some 300 freedom seekers bartered for passage aboard 27 sloops, or chose to sail Indian dugout canoes the 107 miles to Andros Island in the Bahamas. The construction of the lighthouse by the federal government in 1825 effectively blocked the escape route. The Cape Florida lighthouse was completed in 1825, but was damaged during the Second Seminole War. The rebuilt tower, completed in 1846, remains the oldest standing structure in Miami-Dade County. Although the lighthouse was built to save lives and ships, its unflinching light brought an end to this avenue of escape for freedom seekers. "

The community called the church ""the Abolition Church"" which was not a compliment in Jacksonville which had been settled by many persons from the South. The first pastor was Rev. William Carter who had graduated from Yale. He was a member of the ""Yale Band"", a group of new graduates of Yale College who had signed a contract to come to Illinois to find a seminary of learning and found churches. In 1829, the first of these young men arrived. Julian Sturtevant was the first professor of Illinois College which was built on a hill just west of Jacksonville. The leaders of the Congregational Church became the leaders in the UGRR as runaway slaves made their way north from St. Louis. The church welcomed persons of color and on its membership role were three black women, one of whom this church helped to rescue from slavery. Since the UGRR was illegal there is no direct mention of it in the official records of the church. However, the records do note that money was given to Emily Logan to help pay for her legal defense as she petitioned the courts to win her freedom. Fortunately, we have a record from other sources which document the UGRR activity. Many of those involved were members of this church.

The case's victims, Maria Adams and her seven or eight children, ended up as slaves in Texas.

They were sold into slavery in Arkansas, but later rescued. Stories of strange noises upstairs coming from victims, date to 1851.

From the start, Quindaro operated an Underground Railroad, built on anti-slavery sentiments of the Wyandot Tribe who removed to the area in 1843. Geographically positioned on the Missouri River border facing pro-slavery territory, Quindaro served as an intentional and strategic link in the Eastern Kansas Underground Railroad network. Written documents and oral histories illustrate how a cluster of stations and conductors assisted escaping slaves into and out of Quindaro, often using the Parkville, Missouri escape route. Town residents actively assisted kidnapping victims who faced capture and sale to slave dealers. The town hosted an ultimately unsuccessful challenge to voting laws that restricted blacks from the polls. The history of the Underground Railroad at Quindaro has been traced from 1857 through 1864.

The program occurs the 1st and 2nd Saturday in November. Groups limited to 40 depart every 30 minutes on a 1.5-mile evening lantern hike around Indigo Lake and along the Ohio , Erie Towpath Trail. A total of 6 groups participate each night. The group boards the train for their return trip Currently, we do not have conclusive evidence that the Ohio , Erie Canal Towpath Trail was utilized by those escaping slavery on the Underground Railroad (UGRR). However, other similar areas have evidence so we assume that this experience may have occurred at CVNP.

Many freedom seekers passed through Lorain County in their search for the ""Promised Land"" in Canada until about 1861. Lorain County provided a direct route to Lake Erie, as the northern part of the county borders Lake Erie's central basin. However, rather than move on to Canada, many of these freedom seekers felt so safe in the little town of Oberlin that they decided to stay. They lived out their lives in peace among the safe confines of the town, some becoming anti-slavery activists and others being educated at Oberlin College. Because of the commitment of Oberlin's abolitionists, no freedom seekers were ever caught in the town and returned to bondage.

A few even acted to assist freedom seekers through the Underground Railroad. Some were arrested and all suffered threats and harassment. Professor Jonathan Baldwin Turner, a member of the Underground Railroad, helped guide three fleeing Negro women to safe haven from which they eventually reached freedom in Canada.

Dr. Rutherford, Gideon Ashmore a local hotel tavern owner, General Robert Matson a slave owner from Kentucky with a farm north of Oakland, and Abraham Lincoln became involved in the Matson Slave Trial in 1847. Each spring Matson would bring some of his slaves to Illinois to work his Illinois farm and then take them back to Kentucky in the fall after the crops were harvested. One family fearing the wife and children would be sold when they returned to Kentucky fled and sought shelter with well known abolitionists Rutherford and Ashmore. Matson filed a suit against Rutherford and Ashmore in the circuit court under the Black Law, demanding damages in the sum of twenty-five hundred dollars, or five hundred dollars for each slave. This trial became known as the Matson Slave Trial and has been called one of the top 5 Legal Cases in Coles County between 1830-1900. The case was heard in Circuit Court in Charleston in October. The case hinged on the concept that if the slaves were only crossing the state (in transit) they would not be free but if they were located for a time by the consent of the master they would be free. Rutherford and Ashmore won, the slaves were freed, and Matson left town without paying his bills (which included Lincoln's fee)."

When word reached the citizens of Racine, the courthouse bell was rung, and the largest group ever to gather in the city assembled at Haymarket Square (now Monument Square, and an NTF site). Warrants were issued for the arrest of Glover's owner and the U. S. marshal.

Upon their arrival at the Milwaukee jail, they encountered a crowd of protesters estimated to number between 3000 and 5000, demanding Glover's release. Shortly thereafter, a number of those assembled picked up a timber from a nearby construction site. Using it as a battering ram, they freed Glover from jail, whence he was shuttled on a several weeks journey on the Underground Railroad though three additional counties of southeastern Wisconsin, finally being placed aboard a ship in Racine (at Dutton's warehouse, another NTF site), eventually landing in Canada where he spent the next 34 years in freedom, until his death in 1888."

Though dozens of slaves made it across the Mason Dixon line to freedom, many of their slave owners would petition for their return or send slave catchers to retrieve them because of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. Thus, this story allows the viewer to see what life was like after the long journey to freedom for some of the runaways.

Finally, the Consitutional Convention that met in 1864, by abolishing slavery in Maryland, brought the activities of the Underground Railroad to an end."

A special emphasis is placed on the people and events related to Maryland's Underground Railroad. Its themes of survival against all odds; self-determination to reinforce commitment to one another; the importance of family bonds; and the formation and ties of communities through worship are conveyed with a provocative interplay of oral histories, imagery, music and sounds. The program's title is derived from a quote by poet Lucille Clifton in her 1976 poem entitled ""Generations"" -- ""Things don't fall apart. Things hold. Lines connect in ways that last and last and lives become generations made out of pictures and words just kept."" The emotionally charged program shows the poignant difference between those blacks who were free and those who were not. Runaways and other heroes of Maryland's Underground Railroad from throughout the state are featured in the program gallery. They include Josiah Henson, Samuel Denson, Charles Ball, William Parker, Ann Marie Weems, Thomas Smallwood, James Pennington, Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman."

With a price of $3000.00 on their heads, they were betrayed into the hands of the sheriff of Dover, Delaware. They escaped by throwing hot coals into the sheriff's own apartment, jumping out of a twelve-foot high window and leaping over a wall. They made their way to Thomas Garrett in Wilmington, Del., who sent them to William Still in Philadelphia. This dramatic escape story earned them the nickname of the ""Dover Eight.""

The ""Columbia and Philadelphia"" Railroad was built across Belmont in 1829. The western end of the ""Columbia and Philadelphia"" Railroad Bridge across the Schuylkill River was set on the banks of the Belmont property and an inclined plane ran diagonally from the bridge to just north of Belmont.

Menallen Meeting was established in 1780 and worship began at the present site in about 1838. Griest's involvement in the Underground Railroad is established by his collaborative activity with other Quakers and formerly enslaved African Americans who, by the mid-19th century, owned property in the community. This Adams County group is estimated to have been responsible for secreting hundreds - perhaps as many as 1000 freedom seekers. Griest is also recorded as having worked to restore freedom to Kitty Payne, a manumitted slave and the mother of three, who lived in Adams County and who was kidnapped back to the South by agents of her former Virginia owners. Griest, along with fellow Quakers and African American neighbors, gave testimony at the trial in Pennsylvania of her kidnapper in 1845.

On January 16, 1850, Jameson Jenkins assisted a group of runaway slaves escape the hands of slave catchers and took them north to the next stop on the Underground Railroad: Bloomington, Illinois. During the following days, both town newspapers reported various and contradictory stories regarding the runaway slaves, them being caught, and the person who betrayed them. The newspapers later revealed that the person who assisted the runaway slaves was Jameson Jenkins. The newspaper also explained the reasoning behind the various contradictory stories was so that the Underground Railroad car that Jenkins traveled on would not be discovered.

Today the Jenkins lot is located within Lincoln Home National Historic Site, which contains the home of Abraham Lincoln within a historical neighborhood setting. However, the lot is empty, the original Jenkins house was razed sometime between 1896 and 1917.

The area included an iron making complex where freedom seekers were sheltered by some of the free black employees. Daniel Kaufman, who lived on a farm near the ironworks, operated a station at his home and in a secluded wooded area near his home known as Island Grove. A number of village residents, including some of his relatives, assisted Daniel with his work. Daniel Kaufman was sued by a Maryland slave owner in 1847 for assisting thirteen of her slaves who were last traced to his home. This lawsuit led to three trials that attracted statewide attention. Kaufman lost his case in Federal Court and had to pay fines and expenses amounting to approximately $5,000. Daniel Kaufman was one of the youngest and consequently one of the last surviving agents on the UGRR when he died in 1902. His work as an agent and the UGRR activities in the Boiling Springs area are well documented because of the transcripts of two of his trials and the resulting newspaper coverage."

Court and Customs records document the Atlantic slave trade, including the domestic trade between the Port of Philadelphia and southern ports such as Charleston, New Orleans, and Savannah. Other federal court records include cases related to fugitive slaves, who fled from southern plantations to Pennsylvania in the 1840s and 1850s. Among these records are the cases of Passmore Williamson and the Christiana Riot. Both are considered nationally significant U.S. anti-slavery incidents following the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, and were causes celebre for the abolition movement. Correspondence from Ft. Monroe documents the employment of freed slaves and the construction of separate quarters for them after the Emancipation Proclamation.

This influential Black community joined forces with Quakers and other sympathetic whites to form highly successful anti-slavery institutions that had both national and international impact. A strong and diverse regional network of more than 30 sites and six communitities serves as the framework for Philadelphia Quest for Freedom. Unlike traditional trails established for the Underground Railroad, Philadelphia Quest for Freedom enables the public to experience more of the complexities and interlocking nature of the stories and communities. Starting at Independence National Historical Park, where the Liberty Bell, Independence Hall and the new President's House Commemorative Site are located, Philadelphia Quest for Freedom profoundly and deeply grounds the Underground Railroad story within the national experience, and provides a context and catalyst for civic engagement in both past and contemporary issues."

While living in Berkeley Parrish, Spotsylvania County, Virginia, he allegedly tried to coordinate a local slave rebellion in 1815, based on ""heaven-sent"" orders to free the enslaved. His plan was for slaves from Spotsylvania, and surrounding counties to meet at his home with horses, guns, swords and cubs. His plan involved capturing Richmond's magazine or arsenal, and from there he planned to help the participating enslaved reach freedom. An enslaved girl, Lucy, informed her owner, Ptolemy Powell, who then informed the magistrate. The plot was foiled. At least six enslaved people were executed and many others were arrested. Boxley was able to escape from the Spotsylvania County Jail when his wife, brought him a file, which he used to cut his chains and escape to freedom. A thousand dollars reward was offered for Boxley, but he was never caught.

The exhibition is comprised of two types of images, composited views of UGRR sites, and montages that address the broader landscape of slavery through a constructed narrative form. Each UGRR work visually describes an individual location inside and out, including significant architectural features, historical materials, and other details that reveal the story about that site. In order to provide a view into the greater context of slavery and the struggle for freedom, the companion montages blend together images of pertinent locations with historical documents, illustrations, and other artifacts, along with contemporary cultural references. In exhibition, descriptive text accompanies the work.

In addition to exhibitions, I often make lecture presentations with projected visual images of my research. I share the histories of the UGRR sites, and describe the elements incorporated into the montages. I emphasize the importance of understanding our history, and that African American history is American history. Depending on the audience, I also discuss the value of visual documentation and other interpretative strategies for preservation, and for making this history come to life for others, especially younger audiences."

During the Civil War, she led raids for the Union and served as a nurse, scout, and spy. After Emancipation, Tubman turned her great energy toward the woman's suffrage movement, again hoping to push our nation to live up to its responsibility to stand for true civil rights for all. Throughout her life, this courageous woman worked to unite American women and men of all colors and classes in a common struggle for liberty. ""Harriet Tubman Bound for the Promised Land"" is an original secular oratorio for jazz orchestra and chorus composed and written byMarcus Shelby, based on the critically acclaimed biography, Bound For the Promised Land: Harriet Tubman, Portrait of an American Hero, by Kate Clifford Larson (Ballantine/One World, 2004). The oratorio and supporting outreach and education materials tell, through music, the compelling story of Harriet Tubman, a genuine American hero. Marcus Shelby has received generous support from several San Francisco area arts, cultural, and educational organizations and institutions, including the CreativeWork Fund, the LEF Foundation, and the Committee for Black Performing Arts at Stanford University to compose a new work on the life of Harriet Tubman."

After his release from prison, he and his family moved to Massachusetts. Once he became a Baptist preacher, he was called to serve at the Twelfth Baptist Church in Boston. While in Boston, he assisted the Boston Vigilance Committee and was involved in preventing the returns to slavery of freedom seekers Anthony Burns (unsuccessful), Shadrack Minkins, and Thomas Sims under the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act. There is good documentation for Grimes' UGRR activities: trial records in Leesburg, and sources for Boston like Frances Jackson's Vigilance Committee ledgers.

Called a ""great worthy of the Revolution"" by Thomas Jefferson, Dickinson inherited the plantation in 1760 and this experience, along with religious influences, helped him develop a personal philosophy about slavery over his lifetime. The Plantation, as a historic microcosm, chronicles social tensions surrounding the status of individuals who lived and worked on the plantation: free, enslaved, and manumitted; black and white. During the time of Dickinson's ownership, at least three slaves attempted to flee. The conditions of life and the subsequent escape of Clem, a slave of a Dickinson plantation tenant William White, is well documented."

This project explores three broad themes that are critical to understanding the nature of the UGRR as it existed in Southern Indiana. First, it draws attention away from the traditional Boston-New York-Oberlin abolitionist nexus and points to the significance of antislavery activism along the Ohio River. Second, the project draws attention to the biracial nature of abolitionism, particularly at the local level. Finally, the project reveals the central role played by African Americans in the UGRR and provides an unprecedented look at the black community of the Falls region."

The Best Farm is named for the tenant family who occupied it before and during the Civil War; however, it was once part of a 748-acre plantation known as L'Hermitage, which was established by the Vincendieres, a family of French planters from the Caribbean. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries L'Hermitage was home to the second-largest enslaved population in Frederick County, and documents indicate that the owners instituted a harsh form of slavery. Even after the Vincendieres sold the property, slavery continued to be practiced here. Given the inhumanity of slavery, historic research indicates that at L'Hermitage and the Best Farm, freedom seekers exercised personal agency by attempting to escape. The National Park Service has undertaken extensive historical and archeological studies, and as a result L'Hermitage is well-documented through land records, wills, newspaper advertisements, lawsuits, and census records. During the Vincendieres' tenure (50-90 bondsmen), there is documentation of runaway slaves. The names of the escaping men and dates of the runaway advertisements are: Phil (1795) and Jerry (1795).

Bondsmen were tried, lodged, punished (including execution) and sold all on the courthouse lot. Relevant cases are: runaway named Billy documented because of treatment at the jail on 3 succeeding days by a local physician; free black William Hyden unjustly imprisoned in the Brentsville Jail and almost sold into slavery in 1833; Landon a runaway held in the jail, charged with arson, tried, and found guilty, and sentenced to be hung in 1839. Period newspapers provide evidence of antislavery sentiment in the county. Vocal abolitionist John Underwood was brought to trial and found guilty of ""uttering and maintaining that owners have no rights of property in their slaves."" This and other cases show how the county courts tried to repress opposition to slavery within the county.

Hortense fled during a time of great excitement in DC, as thousands of newly organized Union troops poured into the city to quell the rebel uprising in VA. We know of her escape only because the Washington Evening Star on June 17, 1861, reported on her capture: she was found in an encampment of OH soldiers, about 2 miles east of John Little's house. She was, according to the newspaper , ""completely rigged out in male attire."" As punishment, John Little put Hortense in the City Jail for ""safekeeping,"" before taking her back to work in his home. Less than a year after her escape, President Lincoln in April 1862 declared all enslaved African Americans in DC free.

Here Adam brought back his wife and children to live in freedom after they escaped from a plantation in Ellicott City, MD, were caught, jailed in Baltimore, and could not be reclaimed by their master.

The lives of Adam and Emily Plummer are remarkably well documented considering both were born and raised enslaved. Records on the lives of the Plummers include a book by their daughter Nellie Arnold Plummer called ""Out of the Depths,"" letters between Emily and Adam Plummer, and newly recovered portions of a diary by Adam Plummer, now held at Anacostia Museum.
Riversdale is now a house museum, owned and operated by Maryland National Capital Park and Planning Commission.

Others found refuge deep within the swamp, living off the land and what they could steal. These 'outlyers' established maroon communities on the higher points of the swamp.

In the pivotal case of the ""U.S. v. The Amistad"", Story ruled for the majority in 1841. By considering the slaves to be kidnapped Africans, illegally detained and restrained, Justice Story held they were not considered as pirates or the lawful property of a slaveholder. Because the slaves had been illegally seized and transported, their actions to regain their freedom by taking control of the ship were justified as self-defense in spite of the resulting death of the captain. Justice Story ordered the Africans to be freed and allowed to return to their homeland.

Justice Story's later 1822 decision in the complex case of the ""U.S. v. La Jeune Eugenie"", upheld the 1808 law forbidding U.S ships and citizens from importing slaves and went on to order the slaves to be freed."

This pioneering railroad was the eastern-most segment of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's statewide, 390-mile-long Main Line of Public Works. By the late 1830s, this same eastern segment also became one of the most secretive and expeditious transportation corridors for formerly enslaved people to reach freedom in the care of the Vigilance Committee in the City of Philadelphia. African American entrepreneurs William Whipper and Stephen Smith of Columbia owned and operated railroad box cars which were routinely used to transport freight from their successful businesses to and from Philadelphia. Some of these box cars, according to Whipper and other credible sources, were peculiarly constructed with hidden compartments for carrying freight belonging to the Underground Railroad. One account states that no freedom seekers were ever detected using this transport system. Columbia's burgeoning industrial riverfront on the Susquehanna provided employment for large numbers of African Americans as early as circa 1820. This community emerged as a magnet for freedom seekers and humanitarians supporting the anti-slavery cause. Slave catchers were also a constant threat during these years. One abolitionist, William Wright, a Quaker, is widely credited with organizing the system of overland transport of freedom seekers from one Friends' family home or farm to another, a distance of about 10 miles apart, or the distance one could travel overnight by foot or wagon. Together, these factors support the popular anecdotal notion of Columbia as one of the unique places where the movement emerged that became known as the Underground Railroad."

Although her gravestone reads ""wife of John Brown of Harpers Ferry"", Mary A. Brown should be remembered for her personal sacrifices and contributions to the Underground Railroad movement and the abolition of slavery in the United States. The Brown family homes in Springfield, Massachusetts and North Elba, New York were used to shelter freedom seekers. Those who heard of John Brown' support found direct, practical and sympathetic assistance, whether he was at home or away. Mary was active in assisting freedom seekers who were directed to her home, sharing limited family resources, and the risk of possible persecution and prosecution for involvement with her husband's illegal activities. Mary and her family suffered poverty and hardship as a result of John Brown's frequent absences from home. Food and money were in short supply and sickness and death were a part of her life. In 1963, researcher Dr. Clarence Gee of Lockport, NY told wrote the following to ""Kansas City Times"" writer Velma West Sykes, ""It is all true, the hardships she endured, that you have found in your research. But in nothing she ever said or in any of her actions is there any criticism expressed about her husband for the privations suffered by her and her family.""

Based on the number of runaway slave ads indicating the town of Halifax as a final destination, one can conclude that Halifax provided a safe refuge for freedom seekers. Approximately 59 runaway slave advertisements from 1791 to 1840 were posted for 70 freedom seekers running to the town of Halifax. Slave owners specified in the runaway ads that slaves ran to the town of Halifax for several reasons, as listed: having a trade, being known in Halifax; attempting to pass as free; visiting a friend or relative; being hidden by someone in Halifax; having been caught once before in Halifax; etc. The UGRR in Halifax clearly represents the confluence of many communities, slave and free, along with the geographic identifiers of Halifax's border river, the Roanoke."

The property now includes remnants of the mill building and related mill structures, all set amid large boulders that line Rock Creek in a densely-wooded area where the mill once stood.

On July 4, 1836, McAllister'sMill was the site of an early and significant gathering of Abolitioniss in Pennsylvania.

Chaired by mill owner and farmer James McAllister, Jr., the group agreed to publish bold anti-slavery principles, which were reportedly ghost-written by Gettysburg attorney and  later U.S. Congressman Thaddeus Stevens.

The previous year, 1847, while he was a well-known attorney at this location, Stevens paid agents to infiltrate the ranks of slave catchers operating in Lancaster County. He thwarted their plans by alerting Underground Railroad activists before the bounty hunters arrived to capture their targets.

Also in the 1840s and 1850s, Stevens' Caledonia Iron Works in Franklin County, PA, provided employment and support for African Americans through the agency of his superintendent and other Underground Railroad operatives in Franklin and Adams Counties.

As Lancaster County's U.S. Congressman, Stevens served as co-counsel to defendants charged with treason in connection with the Christiana Resistance, which occurred on September 11, 1851.

As Lancaster Congressman, Stevens was an avowed Abolitionist and Constitutional scholar, playing key roles enacting major civil rights Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. The ""Old Commoner"" was one of the prime movers of Reconstruction and the leading advocate for the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson, whom he regarded as too lenient towards the rebellious South."

In 1764, the one-hundred ton brigantine Sally embarked from Providence to West Africa on a slaving voyage. The ship was owned by the four brother firm of Nicholas Brown and Company. This voyage was one of roughly a thousand transatlantic slaving ventures launched by Rhode Islanders in the colonial and early national period, and one of the deadliest. Of the 196 Africans acquired by the ship's master, Esek Hopkins, at least 109 perished, some in a failed insurrection, others by suicide, starvation, and disease. The insurrection is documented in the exhibit and the account has been reproduced and enlarged from the original journal. Although unsuccessful, as most slave trading voyage uprisings were, this revolt demonstrates the African slaves' determination to acquire their freedom. The story of the brave and anonymous slaves onboard the Sally should be shared on a national level and connected to other accounts in the fight for freedom."

Flight to Freedom interprets and educates school children ages 5 to 18 years old and the general public about the establishment and day-to-day life of this historically significant site through first person interpretation and living history demonstrations. Using the voice of several different characters based on persons documented to have lived at Fort Mose, the story of resistance to slavery through escape and flight to the South is told to visitors via a 3-part, guided tour; African drumming; re-enactment of military drills; historic cooking demonstrations; and various other hands-on activities."

They crossed the Ohio River near Madison, IN (Jefferson County). They were conveyed via the Underground Railroad from there to Decatur County. While in Decatur County the family was recaptured by Woodson Clark, a pro-slavery resident of the area. But with the help of black and white abolitionists, the family escaped again and were helped further north through Underground Railroad stations in northern Decatur County, Rush, and Union Counties. After the escape, George Ray successfully brought a civil case against Luther Donnell, a member of the community who had assisted in the escape. According to William M.

Quindaro was used as an ideological battleground for pro and anti slavery forces to determine whether the Kansas territory would come into statehood as a free-state. In the process of the debate, and well into the 20th century, formerly enslaved Africans migrated to Kansas, first as runaway slaves and later as Exodusters searching for freedom.

The museum, located in Wyandotte County, Kansas opened on September 12, 2008 under the auspices of the Concerned Citizens of Old Quindaro, a nonprofit organization. The museum is housed in a 19th century two-story-bungalow formerly owned by John Walker-- the grounds keeper for Western University (a now defunct African American university). Walker, who was instrumental in the installation of the famous John Brown statue, helped to preserve the area's African American history. The museum continues his work by preserving and disseminating the history of Quindaro through exhibits, lectures, tours and other programs.

Planter's House. In 1859, the hotel was the site of a kidnapping. Charles Fisher (a.k.a Peter Fisher), who worked at the hotel as a barber, was abducted from the hotel under suspicion of being a fugitive slave or being in violation of the fugitive slave act by assisting others in their escapes. After being arrested at gunpoint and handcuffed, Fisher who maintained he was free was taken into Missouri. Fisher, however, was able to escape and returned to Leavenworth. The two kidnappers were subsequently charged with kidnapping and brought to trial. Fisher was subpoenaed as a material witness despite prohibitions against blacks testifying against whites in court. Meanwhile, a man came forward claiming to be Fisher's owner and Fisher was detained in the custody of the Marshal at Planters Hotel. Fisher was able to escape with the help of free-state men, but was ultimately recaptured and sold into slavery. Fisher, however, once again found his way to freedom and returned to Leavenworth in 1863.

The Planters Hotel was torn down in the 1950s and the site, which is privately owned, is currently an empty lot. However, the City of Leavenworth has utilized its right away to put a marker and re-creation of the hotel steps, commemorating the hotel's existence, especially as it was related to Abraham Lincoln's 1859 visit.

While Mrs. Keckly is best known as the seamstress/confidante of Mary Todd Lincoln and author of ""Behind the Scenes"", her largely forgotten work on behalf of the newly emancipated slaves deserves recognition. As the Civil War progressed, many of these former bondsmen, also known as contrabands, sought refuge in the nation's capital, often arriving with little more than the clothing on their backs.

Some mistakenly believed the government would feed and clothe them as their former masters had done. Unfortunately, the government was slow to adopt a policy for helping the newly arrived freedmen, who were in desperate need of basic necessities. Elizabeth Keckly, realizing their plight, devoted herself to raising funds and collecting donations for their benefit. In 1862, she organized the Contraband Relief Association (CRA) at Union Bethel AME Church. Mrs. Keckly founded and served as the first president of the group of forty volunteers.

The CRA and similar societies helped expose the need for more government involvement in caring for the contrabands and helped set the standard for providing aid and sustenance to the former slaves.

The fort exists to defend the nearby waterways and the adjacent Potomac River. Part of the landscape is the water nearby. Visible from Fort Washington, there is a site off Diggs Point at the mouth of Swann Creek relevant to the Underground Railroad. A mass escape of enslaved African Americans occurred in early September 1814. They escaped to a British ship moored there which had come down the Potomac River from occupied Alexandria, Virginia. Nearby, Fort Washington had just been blown up by the commander to avoid falling into the hands of the British.

During the War of 1812 the British successfully attacked Washington. In order to undermine the local economy, a British Proclamation offered freedom to enslaved African Americans.  The escape of African Americans to the British near Fort Washington is documented by depositions sworn in the 1820s by plantation owners, from Prince George's County, seeking compensation from the British. None of the freedom seekers was recaptured. Of the group it is only known that at least one went to Nova Scotia and three to Bermuda.

The McCoy cabin, no longer standing, was the couple's home upon their return to the United States. Sometime before 1839 with her emancipated husband, Millie escaped bondage in Louisville, Kentucky, traveling the Underground Railroad through Ohio eventually landing in Canada. In Colchester Ontario, the McCoys raised their children (including famed inventor Elijah McCoy), and in the late 1850s moved to the Starkweather farm and began operations on the Underground Railroad there. Underground Railroad networks from Ohio and western states intersected in Ypsilanti, then radiated out to crossing points along the Detroit River.

The evidence of the McCoys' Underground Railroad activities comes from daughter, Anna McCoy, fourth of twelve children. In an interview by Professor Mary Goddard of Eastern Michigan University (1913), Anna recalled specific names and incidents neither published, nor known. She remembered her mother cooking and sending the children to bed early and her father, George McCoy, departing with hidden cargo in his tobacco wagon. Though the McCoy's cabin is gone, the original 1844 Greek-Revival Starkweather house is a strong physical reminder of the farm during the period of the McCoys' residence and their Underground Railroad activities. The house is a stop on the Journey to Freedom Tour (NTF Program). Guides describe how Millie and George McCoy risked their freedom while helping others escape slavery."

Unfortunately, any prohibition on the use of enslaved labor was often ignored by the region's planters. However, at Los Adaes, cattle ranching and subsistence farming was the primary economic pursuit for the residents, thereby eliminating the need for enslaved laborers. As a borderland community, Adaes was not self-sufficient and residents engaged in trade for food with the French at Natchitoches.

In late 1861 he was put in charge of constructing Confederate fortifications near the county seat of Leesburg, Virginia. General D.H. Hill, the senior officer in the county, ordered all able-bodied males - black and white -- not serving in the regular military be put to digging earthworks. To avoid the work, many fled north, including Noble Robinson, 24, a slave of Giddings. Robinson fled Melrose on January 12, 1862, to Union forces some eight miles away at Point of Rocks, Maryland, on the Potomac River. Two weeks later, with the permission of Federal officers, Robinson slipped back into Virginia and rescued his wife Martha and three young children, enslaved at a nearby plantation."

Dr. Richard Eppes was in America's top 1% of the plantation elite, by owning 130 enslaved people, and one of the wealthiest men in the country.

From 1635 when Frances Eppes claimed this property based on the headrights of indentured people he brought from England - five of this group were black servants, to the end of the Civil War, there are stories of escape, resistance, freedom, and citizenship that connected the beginning of slavery in this country to its physical and Constitutional demise."

John Cross,Rev.

Founded by Underground Railroad activist, the Institute was first led by well-known abolitionist and Underground Railroad conductor, Rev. John Cross. After years of financial struggle the Wesleyans brought fellow abolitionist Rev. Jonathan Blanchard to take leadership of the struggling institution. Blanchard was one of Theodore Dwight Weld's Seventy and a conductor on the Underground Railroad in Cincinnati and Western Illinois. According to a memoir by Ezra Cook in Charles Clark's ""History of the Thirty-Ninth Regiment Illinois Volunteer Veteran Infantry"" (published under the auspices of the Veteran Association of the Regiment in 1889), ""runaway slaves were perfectly safe in the College building, even when no attempt was made to conceal their presence.With hundreds of others, I have seen and talked with such fugitives in the college chapel. Of course they soon took a night train well-guarded to the next station on the U. G. R. R."" (p. 490). Cook provides the first ""hard"" evidence to support the claims of Underground Railroad activity occurring on campus. In 1859, Blanchard renamed the school Wheaton College, which is still in existence, to honor benefactor and Illinois Institute trustee Warren L. Wheaton.

Blanchard Hall is a symbol of Wheaton's unique pioneering role in abolitionism, its matriculation of women on an equal basis, and its matriculation of students of color, including the graduation of the Illinois' first African-American college graduate.

In 1979 Blanchard Hall was added to the National Register of Historic Places."

Evidence of the incident is found in several printed versions of the episode and in a paper written in 1905 by Julia Wolcott Carter, the daughter of Elihu Wolcott, the acknowledged leader of the Underground Railroad movement in Jacksonville. Carter's evidence is based on her interview with Underground Railroad activist Jonathan Baldwin Turner. According to Turner, the three women had been hidden ""in an old shanty on what is now known as the Fitzsimmons place (the Gillett property)"" before being transported to another location.

New Philadelphia, Illinois was a gathering place for African Americans of the region and, although integrated, regarded by many local residents as a black town.

Founded in 1836, New Philadelphia is the first town in our nation legally registered by an African American. The town traces its association to resist enslavement to founder Frank McWorter. Before moving to Illinois from Kentucky in 1830, McWorter purchased freedom for his wife, himself and a son who had fled to Canada. Risking capture by slave trackers, the McWorters returned to Kentucky to purchase freedom for family members. McWorter freed sixteen family members with funds earned through entrepreneurial enterprises.

Now an archaeological site with only a few building foundations visible on the landscape, New Philadelphia was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2005 for its potential to provide nationally significant information about the lifeways and relationships of African Americans and European Americans in a pioneer setting, and designated a National Historic Landmark in 2009 for its potential to yield information of major scientific importance and to affect archaeological theories, concepts and ideas.

The site is owned by The Archaeological Conservancy, The New Philadelphia Association, and The Philadelphia Land Trust.

While many African-Americans moved on after the war, some stayed and became a part of the community.

Fort Scott National Historic Site is part of the National Park System and recognized as a National Historic Landmark. It was a US Army frontier fort from 1842-1853, guarding the Permanent Indian Frontier. The fort buildings were auctioned in 1855 and became the nucleus of the civilian Town of Fort Scott, which was a center of Bleeding Kansas intrigue during territorial days (1855-1861). Predominantly pro-slave at its founding, the town and county developed a free-state focus by 1859. The town was fortified during the Civil War and became the primary US Army supply depot, training center, and general hospital in southeast Kansas.

The existing building is the ca. 1800 Chesapeake Tidewater-style frame domestic dwelling with a ca. 1850 log kitchen wing. Many of his experiences of living as a slave on the Riley property are vividly depicted in his memoirs and are recreated in Stowe's fictional account. Henson eventually escaped to Canada, where he established a ""fugitive slave"" colony and became a speaker and writer. Josiah Henson's narrative of his road from slavery to freedom received worldwide praise and readership. During the height of its publication, Henson's story was the third most popular slave narrative in the world, following the seminal works produced by Frederick Douglass and Olaudah Equiano. By 1877, ""The Life of Josiah Henson"" had sold over a quarter of a million copies.

The site's connection to the Underground Railroad stems from the fact that many of the soldiers who comprised the First Kansas Colored were former Missouri Slaves who had escaped into Kansas and freedom. In October of 1862, several months before the Emancipation Proclamation, these African American soldiers marched into Bates County with orders to clear out the band of southern sympathizing guerrillas who had gathered there.

Word of this victory spread quickly and prompted large numbers of enslaved people to escape from the mainland and Roanoke Island to freedom on Hatteras Island. Responsibility for sheltering and feeding these former enslaved people fell on the Union forces. Hotel De'Afrique was part of that provision. Hundreds of runaways arrived and in exchange for unloading supply vessels received food and housing. Many of these freedom seekers were able to provide strategic information regarding Confederate positions. This information led to Union victories. Hotel De'Afrique was the first contraband camp to be established by the military in North Carolina, therefore providing the first safe haven for freedom seekers in the state.

There were two sites for Hotel De'Afrique on Forts Clark and Hatteras. They have both since disappeared due to erosion and flooding. A monument was established to tell the story in April 2012.

At Honey Springs Americans of all colors fought and died with determination to win liberty for themselves and their cause. With courage men willingly proved themselves and fought for justice, honor and freedom.

Freedom was as diverse as the cultures represented. To some freedom meant returning to life as it was before the Civil War, to some it included living peaceably in a new land and for others freedom from the bonds of slavery.

For freedmen and runaway slaves Honey Springs was an opportunity to overthrow oppression and many found themselves on the frontlines of freedom.

Mitchelville was established in 1862 to provide a community where freedom seekers could live and self-govern under their new-found freedom under the protection of the Union Army. Mitchelville was the clearest example of the Port Royal Experiment, whereby formerly enslaved people developed fighting skills as well as skills needed to prosper as American citizens. By 1864, Union units were being drawn to aid operations further north. As the number of troops dwindled, military operations in the area transitioned from offensive to defensive. Three major new earthworks were constructed on Hilton Head, including Fort Howell, which was located to provide protection for Mitchelville. Fort Howell was constructed in part by the 32nd Infantry Regiment, United States Colored Troops Infantry (USCT). This unit, mustered in Pennsylvania from free Black volunteers coming from Maryland, Delaware, and Pennsylvania.

Two distinct phases qualified Mitchelville as an important Underground Railroad site. It was the site of mass escapes from Hilton Head Island plantations when Union troops entered Port Royal Sound in November 1861. As the battle began, many of those enslaved on the island escaped into the nearby forests, where they hid until Union troops fully occupied the area. After its establishment, Mitchelville then became the destination for waves of freedom seekers fleeing bondage in the nearby Confederate states of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. Mitchelville was the heart of the ""Port Royal Experiments,"" termed a ""rehearsal for Reconstruction."" The federal experiments proved to a skeptical American public that African Americans would fight for freedom and country, work for wages within a free enterprise labor system, and live responsibly as independent citizens. Mitchelville was constructed, inhabited, and governed exclusively by previously enslaved freedom seekers. Activities in this settlement were heavily covered by northern newspapers. The successes at Mitchelville ultimately influenced national Reconstruction policies."

The steamboat probably landed at the present site of the City of Seaford's Riverwalk, like most steamers with passengers. This area was the center of town in the time. Harriet and Tilly spent the night at the hotel at the top of the hill, where Gateway Park is today. They were nearly arrested by slave traders the next morning, but safely continued on their
way by train to Camden, Delaware and then by carriage to Thomas Garrett in Wilmington. Tubman expert, Dr. Kate Larson, referred to the Tilly story in her book, Harriet Tubman, Portrait of an American Hero, as €œone of her most complicated and clever escape attempts€.

The monument is a standing memorial of the Iowa Territorial Supreme Court's first case, ""In the Matter of Ralph, (a colored man,) on Habeas Corpus"" (1839). Installed in 2009, the public art sculpture designed by artist James Ellwanger commemorates the 170th anniversary of this landmark fugitive slave court case. This case began in 1834 when an enslaved man by the name of Ralph Montgomery contracted with his owner Jordan Montgomery to travel to Iowa. Ralph went to Dubuque with the intent of mining the local mineral fields in order to gain the 550 dollars required to purchase his freedom. After failing to uphold his end of the written contract, Ralph was then captured as a fugitive slave to be sent back to his owner in Missouri. The intervention of two Irish farmers, Patrick Quigley and Alexander Butterworth, allowed Ralph to be returned to Dubuque for a fair trial. The case was quickly sent on to the Territorial Supreme Court where Ralph was fittingly declared free on the Fourth of July in the summer of 1839 because the court held, ""no man in this territory can be reduced to slavery.""

Unable to do so, Tubman was informed by the mother of another freedom seeker she had helped escape sometime before that four enslaved men laboring in Dorchester County, MD, were ready to leave with her instead. It was a long and difficult trip, with slave catchers hot on their trail. UGRR agent Sydney Gay of New York City, wrote that ""Captain Tubman"" had arrived safely with her charges on May 14th. The four men had come from ""the same neighborhood,"" that is, ""Cabin Creek"" outside of East New Market along the Choptank River. Benjamin Jackson and James Coleman had both been enslaved by Isaac Henry Wright, whose plantations included some of the largest peach farms on the Eastern Shore. The third freedom seeker, Henry Hopkins, was enslaved by John Houston, also from East New Market/Secretary, and the fourth, William A. Connoway [aka Cook], was enslaved by Levin Hodson. Tubman had led them safely to New Castle, Delaware, but the relentless slave catchers eager for the high rewards for their capture slowed them down, forcing them to stay hidden for several days. Thomas Garrett in Wilmington, DE, was able to finally forward them to William Still, UGRR agent in Philadelphia. Still noted their arrival and forwarded them onto Gay who sent them onto Syracuse. They arrived in Canada, settling among other freedom seekers they knew. The nominated site, the Kral Farm, remains intact and includes nearly about one-half of the original and larger farm estate of Isaac Henry Wright, from whom Jackson and Coleman fled.

Skinner, a farmer living near Greensboro.Finding that he no longer could use Richard's labour, Skinner leased him, illegally, to Edward Taylor, another farmer near Greensboro, sometime around 1852.Taylor was cruel and abusive.When Richard's parents sued in court to cancel their son's indenture, Taylor schemed to sell Potter as a slave.In a trap set by Taylor, Potter was kidnapped from Taylor's farm and sold to a man named Vaughn, who lived near Concord, in Sussex, DE. With search parties hot on Potter's trail, Vaughn decided to kill him.Fortunately, young Richard fled from the Vaughn home and found refuge with a sympathetic neighbour, Mrs. Short.Potter was rescued and brought back to Denton, Caroline Co., and while resting on the steps of the local hotel at this site on Courthouse Square, he was greeted by his joyful parents and cheering crowds. Potter's indenture, kidnapping, and rescue are vividly documented in his memoir, ""The Narrative of the Experience, Adventures, and Escape of Richard Potter,"" first published in 1866."

The Stapleforts advertised a $150 reward for the capture and return of the thirty-six year old man, noting that Manoca was a very skilled man, ""a great sawyer, having followed it ever since he was about 18 years of age.""The Stapleforts believed that Manoca was heading to Baltimore, then on to Philadelphia or New York.Given his experience as a sawyer and the Staplefort's home on a navigable river, Manoca would have been familiar with the watermen who manned the vessels that carried the coveted timber to shipyards throughout the Chesapeake and as far away as New England.Such relationships would have facilitated quick and reliable transportation for his escape. The farm, now wholly included within the boundaries of Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge and situated along Wildlife Drive, is also located across the river from the site where Harriet Tubman's mother and grandmother were once enslaved.

Up in the hayloft or wedged into false-bottomed wagons, the formerly enslaved waited until the dark of night to be carried across the Detroit River to Canada or other hiding places in Michigan. Finney's son and Underground Railroad participants identified Finney's Barn as a key station in the region in the decade before the Civil War. Finney embraced the Free-Soil, and then Republican Party. In 1864, retired from the hotel business, Finney publicly lectured for racial equality. As early as 1878, Finney's Barn was described in Michigan history books as a station on the Underground Railroad. Despite its historical significance, the barn was razed for the Detroit Chamber of Commerce building in 1892.

Informational plaques that surround the sculpture memorialize participants, black and white, enslaved and free that contributed to the Sandusky's evolution as a terminus of the Underground Railroad.

The sculpture's location, 50 yards from Sandusky Bay, is symbolic of Sandusky's strategic waterfront location, where only Lake Erie separated fugitive slaves from true freedom on the Canadian mainland, a mere 35 miles north of Sandusky.

Sandusky's role in Underground Railroad activities is well documented. Levi Coffin, President of the Underground Railroad, revealed that Sandusky was an important route to freedom. Harriet Beecher Stowe referenced Sanduskyin the fictional but based on historical fact, ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"", released in 1852. In 1854, in two separate legal cases, the federal government tried noted Sandusky abolitionist Rush Sloane for violating the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act for orchestrating an escape of captured slaves. However, these incidences barely touch the surface of Sandusky's relevance to the Underground Railroad."

In 1864 Robert Ball Anderson escaped enslavement by fleeing his owner's plantation in Kentucky. He enlisted in the Union army at the nearest recruiting station and joined the 125th United States Colored Infantry. Although he did not fight against the Confederacy, he saw service on the western frontier. Anderson mustered out in 1867 and began a long journey to become one of the most successful African American landowners in Nebraska. Failure, setback and hardships continuously confronted him. However, self-reliance, intelligence, thriftiness, generosity and an affable personality allowed him to become a prominent figure in a predominately white environment. Anderson became an integral part of his community, and he represented a beacon of hope on the frontier for African Americans. He acquired wealth and thousands of acres and eventually married at the age of 79 Anderson. He enjoyed eight years with his young bride, Daisy Anderson before tragically dying from injuries sustained in a car accident on November 30, 1930.

The group was disguised as a funeral cortege going to the city's only integrated cemetery, Wesleyan, in Cumminsville.  The buggies and coaches carrying them skirted Wesleyan Cemetery and went up to College Hill by this back route.

Both men were leaders of Detroit's African American community and documented Underground Railroad activists, instrumental in the Colored Vigilant Committee of Detroit. Rev.

It is an all-volunteer member organization dedicated to the promotion of local history and the study of genealogy.

During the Civil War, Hilton Head Island was captured early in the conflict by Union forces on November 7, 1861, in the Battle of Port Royal, and the island became the Headquarters of the Department of the South, tasked with blockading Confederate vessels along the coast of the Carolinas, Georgia and northern Florida.The island became a protective haven for many of the contraband slaves from the island plantations as well as from the mainland of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.With Union assistance, the contrabands established Mitchelville, the first self-governing freedman village in the United States.

The library has discovered many of the stories of these contrabands through our research of the people of Mitchelville, and of the pensions of the United States Colored Troops from Hilton Head.One such story is about March Haines, born enslaved in Pocataligo, South Carolina, and as a young man was hired out as a boat pilot and stevedore. Eventually, he became a carpenter at Ft. Pulaski.Once freed under
Major-General David Hunter's orders, Haines became active in the war effort.He secreted a boat near Savannah and brought a large number of freedom seekers to Hilton Head, eventually settling himself and his wife in Mitchelville. He became a soldier of the 21 Regiment of the United States Colored Troops, and eventually was elected the
marshal of Mitchelville."

It was a site of escapes from slavery beginning in 1817. The first farm owner for whom there are documented escapes was John Love (1750-1834). John Love inherited slaves from his father Samuel. He owned 12-21 slaves during the 1790s through 1820. Love is paradoxical, since he helped and defended free African Americans but also enslaved other African Americans like Jane and Robin who felt compelled to resist by escape. As Love, an attorney in Alexandria and Fauquier County, became successively State Delegate, US Congressman, and State Senator, he used overseers at Buckland Farm. One, his nephew Richard Hendley Love, in 1817 advertised for freedom seeker Robin. The nephew later advertised for Jane Williams a ""runaway"" who sued for her freedom, but was jailed and escaped in the District of Columbia in 1818. Another overseer who lived on the estate was Griffin Stith who advertised in 1821 for Toby who escaped while being held during a lawsuit.

The next owner of Buckland Farm was Love's cousin Temple Mason Washington. From him Washington Hayes and Ariadne Taylor escaped in 1842 and Thornton escape in 1853."

It is currently owned by Fauquier County and run as a county historical museum by the Fauquier Historical Society. It is unusual because jail records have survived from 1759, which was when the county was established.

The jail complex is significant to the Underground Railroad, because it was used to house those captured while attempting to escape slavery. The jail also has housed free people caught without their papers, who risked being sold into slavery. Runaway ads and court records indicate the use of public jails as holding places, showing yet another example of the institutionalization of slavery."

bondage, and the wharf on which it sits was a main departure point for maroons/fugitives seeking freedom.While the dynamic of flight shifted in the period 1733-1848, where sometime freedom seekers from other colonies sought passage through Christiansted, most of the flight was towards Puerto Rico where, after a brief period of bondage, maroon/fugitives could be freed. At least 324 people are known to have arrived in Puerto Rico from Christiansted through ""maritime marronage"" in the period 1733-1848. St. Croix is one of the few islands in the Caribbean colonized continuously from 400 BCE to the present, with intensive European colonization in the 15th-19th Centuries that included the English, French, Dutch, Spanish, and eventually the Danish Royal Crown.Denmark ran the Danish West Indies from
1680-1917, and occupied St. Croix from 1733-1917.The United States purchased the Danish West Indies and established the U.S. Virgin Islands in 1917 where it still operates the islands as an unincorporated territory of the United States.

An unknown Congregation clergyman brought the group of freedom seekers to Merritt's residence to rest before escorting them to the next station. During and after the Civil War, Merritt served in a variety of public offices including state representative (1870-1872) and mayor of Red Oak. He passed away on January 11, 1922."

It traces the development of the African American community in Elgin, Illinois, which origins date back to October 15, 1862 when approximately 110 freedom seekers, predominately women and children from northern Alabama, traveled by train to the city in two box cars. The freedom seekers who had escaped during the chaos of the Civil War, first found refuge behind Union Lines at Corinth, Mississippi before being transported by train by former Elgin resident Rev. Benjamin F. Thomas, a chaplain in the 52nd Infantry Illinois. ""Project 2-3-1"" examines ""how these ex-slaves created a new life in a city that was both a mix of abolition sentiment and racial intolerance. The story continues through the civil rights era of the 1960s and into today focusing on the challenges and accomplishments of the community.""

Thornton and Lucie (originally Ruthie) Blackburn, husband and wife, were freedom seekers who had escaped from Louisville, Kentucky and after living in Detroit two years were arrested, tried, and convicted as fugitive slaves under the 1793 Fugitive Slave Act. During these events, the Wayne County Jail where the couple was being held, became a site of interracial protest on behalf of the couple. Awaiting their return to Kentucky, the Blackburn couple first Lucie and then Thornton, were rescued, liberated and assisted across the Detroit River into Canada in a carefully planned escape by African American community leaders who would three years later in 1836, found the legendary Underground Railroad station in Detroit, Second Baptist Church. Despite the fact that the Blackburns successfully made it to freedom, the protest continued. In connection with the rescue and riots, members of the African American community were arrested and held in the jail. Meanwhile, British officials refused two extradition attempts, creating Canada's first refugee reception policy in order to protect the Blackburns. This landmark case created Canada as the legal terminus for the Underground Railroad; today's modern Canadian extradition law still rests on its principles. The former jail site is now occupied by the Rose and Robert Skillman Branch of the Detroit Public Library."

At any given time, an estimated 1,500 to 6,000 people were part of this vibrant community, which consisted of homes, trade shops, a hospital, church, and school house. Hundreds of acres were put under the plow and everyone earned a wage. The men from the camp enlisted to swell the ranks of the Union army and many saw combat.

A 21-acre portion of the original Contraband Camp is developed as a commemorative park. Positioned along a paved walkway are several life-sized bronze statues of newly freed men and women engaged in the daily activites of the camp.

Many whose roots extended back to the church played pivotal roles in Underground Railroad activities not only in Ohio, but across the nation as it expanded west. Despite the congregation's tremendous influence in the struggle against slavery and the Underground Railroad, their role has largely been unrecognized.

Abolitionist Levi Coffin grew up north of the site and references these woods between his home and his New Garden Quaker Meeting as a place of refuge.

The legacy of justice continued with documented anti-slavery activists serving on the initial staff of New Garden Boarding School when it opened in 1837. An 1842 runaway notice in the local paper specifically references the New Garden community.

The site includes the home the Garfields purchased in 1876 and that was the site of Garfield's 1880 ""front porch"" presidential campaign. Garfield was anti-slavery in the years leading up to the Civil War and evidence shows that at least twice in his early life, James Garfield provided assistance to freedom seekers. Once the war began he joined the Union army to help save the nation and abolish slavery. Garfield made it very clear that slavery was, in his view, the primary cause of the war. As a Union officer, he expressed great frustration at being unable to help enslaved African Americans escape the ""peculiar institution."" During his Civil War service, he advocated for and participated in the Union army freeing those enslaved in the South and providing refuge for African Americans trying to escape from plantations and the Confederacy. During his long career in the House of Representatives (1863-1881), Garfield was a steady and constant supporter of the civil and political rights of the formerly enslaved. Upon becoming President in 1881, Garfield, one of the few prominent Republicans still vocally advocating for civil rights, called ""the elevation of the Negro race from slavery to the full rights of citizenship the most important political change we have known since the adoption of the Constitution of 1787."" His work for the abolition of slavery and African American civil rights, including participating in the Underground Railroad makes James A. Garfield National Historic Site€the only national site dedicated to the interpretation of President Garfield's life and career€a highly appropriate site to include on the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom."

John Rankin, a well-known Underground Railroad conductor. John Rankin assumed pastoral duties at First Presbyterian Church in 1822. While living here, John Rankin expressed his anti-slavery feelings by writing his ""Letters on Slavery"", which were published in the Castigator, a local anti-slavery newspaper that operated out of one of the home's apartments. In 1828, fearing those who opposed his anti-slavery lectures, Rankin bought land and built a house, overlooking the river valley. While it is this later residence located on what came to be known as ""Liberty Hill"" that is most associated with Rankin's Underground Railroad activities, he was also associated with activities at his earlier Front Street home, even after he no longer resided there. Indications of this come from an incident that occurred when William and Lucinda McNishe, Rankin's brother in-law and sister in-law, who purchased the home from Rankin in 1828 were living there. In the 1830s a teenage enslaved girl who had escaped from Maysville, Kentucky came to their door because she knew the house with three front doors was a gateway to freedom. With John Rankin's help, the McNishes were able to get the girl away from Ripley and safely on her journey north to freedom."

The house began as a summer home in 1863 (when construction completed), becoming a primary residence from 1873 until the President's death in 1893. Early in his career, probably as a result of his wife's anti-slavery influence, Hayes defended fugitive slaves as a lawyer in Cincinnati, helping to uphold the freedom of Rosetta Armstead and other enslaved people who had escaped from the South. As a general in the northern army during the Civil War he fought specifically for the purpose of ending slavery stating, ""freedom, freedom for all. We all know that is the essence of this contest.""

Smalls was born enslaved on April 5, 1839, in Beaufort, South Carolina. When Smalls was 12, his owner, Henry McKee, sent the boy to Charleston to be hired out. Smalls' love of the sea led him to work on the docks and wharves of Charleston, which quickly made him deeply knowledgeable of Charleston Harbor.  In the fall of 1861, Smalls was assigned to steer the CSS Planter (a lightly armed Confederate military transport). On May 12, 1862, the Planter's three white officers decided to spend the night ashore. At about 3 a.m. the following morning, Smalls and seven of the eight enslaved crewmen made a run for the Union ships blockading the harbor. Smalls, dressed in the captain's uniform and a straw hat, not only sailed the Planter out of the southern wharf, but also stopped to free his and the crewman's families. Smalls became a hero and his accomplishments were celebrated in the North and among African Americans nationwide. He went on to dedicate his life to achieving equality for all. He held a variety of public offices, including severing five terms in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Smalls died February 23, 1915, and is buried in the Tabernacle Baptist Church cemetery in Beaufort. Tabernacle Baptist Church is an active congregation."

It is not clear if the men were free or had escaped, but regardless of their status they were treated as if they were freedom seekers traveling along the Underground Railroad. The men were forwarded to Edward Sheldon and Newton Woodford, who planned to transport the men to Lewis, Iowa in a covered wagon. However, their journey was temporarily cut short when they were spotted by a band of pro-slavery men in Mud Creek who had obtained a warrant from Justice of the Peace John Cramer for the arrest of Sheldon and Woodford for aiding the four men escape from slavery. Sheldon and Woodford were jailed in Glenwood, Iowa and brought to trial, where they were acquitted of all charges. Meanwhile proslavery men began to transport the four men to Missouri. Sheldon did not let his brush with the law deter him and shortly after being released, he, along with several abolitionists from Tabor, Iowa, went on to rescue the four men.

Local history and family records provide documentation that beginning in the 1830s, the Batchelder, Beebe/Beach, Brown, Cook, and Cushing families provided direct assistance for a large number of freedom seekers. In 1843, Samuel Cushing was taken to court, accused of assisting fugitives. These families provided leadership and support for the congregation and the cemetery association. In addition, the Cole and Safford families who were active in assisting freedom seekers are buried in the cemetery although they helped start the Methodist Church.

One incident involved two freedom seekers that were transported to the barn and the other involved eleven ""slaves"" and a free-born baby who were hidden at the Grover barn in January 1859. The abolitionist, John Brown and his men had helped to liberate the group from slavery in Missouri the previous December in a highly publicized raid. After a brief stay at Grover barn on his last trip to Kansas, Brown led the freedom seekers to Detroit, Michigan, and saw them cross over into Canada. The Grover barn and a portion of the original farm remained in the Grover family for 105 years.

Though most known for its role as a focal point for colonial protests against Parliament in the years leading up to the American Revolution, Faneuil Hall later served as an important gathering space for public dissent and organized resistance to the fugitive slave laws of the country, making it an integral site in the Underground Railroad network. Beginning in the late 1830s, Boston's abolitionists began regularly using Faneuil Hall to host their meetings and rallies. Oftentimes, they called these meetings in response to high profile fugitive slave cases in the city. The abolitionists not only protested the arrest of fugitive slaves but also actively organized against the fugitive slave laws here. They pressured state and local officials to resist enforcing these federal laws and formed vigilance committees to assist those seeking freedom on the Underground Railroad, encouraging supporters to help those in need and thwart the slave catchers. Faneuil Hall provided an important venue where black and white abolitionists gathered to plan their collective action in support of those seeking their freedom on the Underground Railroad."

After spending his early years as a field hand and carriage driver, he escaped in 1863. A runaway ad in the Baltimore Sun on February 3, 1863, documented his escape and called for his capture. Gray either eluded capture or it was short-lived as one year later he enlisted with the United States Colored Troops (USCT) in Baltimore. Surviving the war, his life as a free man in and around Baltimore is documented in pension, city directory and census records. He worked, married and raised a family. He was buried in Loudon Park National Cemetery upon his death in 1922. His post-escape life defied the stereotype of the helpless freedman.

The fort was built with the help of Black Cuban soldiers and manned by Black British Colonial Marines who had received their freedom by joining the British to fight against the Americans. The British posted hand bills across the south inviting all slaves to come to the fort to find freedom. Thousands took up the offer. By the time the war ended, maroon plantations extended for fifty miles upriver from the fort. After the British left in 1815, the fort served as a portal to freedom for increasing numbers of escaped slaves. During the fort's two-year operation, slaves from as far away as Virginia and as near as Pensacola came here. Transported by the British or finding their way on their own, formerly enslaved persons departed from the Negro Fort to establish free communities that still exist in the Bahamas, Mexico, Trinidad, Nova Scotia, Sierra Leone, Cuba, Texas , and Florida.

Constructed in 1837, this is the most significant pre-Civil War public building still standing in northern Illinois. For decades, freedom seekers escaping from the south and traveling north along the Mississippi River valley often came up the Illinois River valley and then headed for Chicago, often along the route of the Canal.

There is also evidence of the Canal as a site of rescue for some being transported back to slavery. The use of the canal in UGRR activities was facilitated by activists who lived along the canal and canal leaders and workers who were supporters of the abolitionist cause. For instance, Peter Stewart, who served as superintendent of the Canal after it opened in 1848 was indicted in 1843 for assisting fugitives and talked of himself as €œpresident€ of the Underground Railroad in Illinois.

Among the key settlers was the family of Jan and Aagje Ton, who, in 1853, acquired property on the north side of the Little Calumet River. This area was an important transportation route. Near their farm, early settlers developed a ferry, then toll bridge, across the river. Starting in 1837, the heavy traffic between Chicago and Detroit was funneled across this ferry and bridge. For the next 20 + years, this also became the major road for the movement of freedom seekers. The Ton Farm's proximity to routes going in and out of Chicago, provided opportunities for participation in the Underground Railroad. The Tons, working with others in the area, assisted freedom seekers traveling by lake or overland from the Chicago area to Detroit and Canada.

Spencer died on March 8, 1822, leaving Garnet's family “ then using the surname Trusty “ at risk for being sold by Spencer's heirs. Garnet's father received permission to attend a funeral in a neighboring county, enabling the family's escape sometime between Spencer's death and May 1822. The Trustys and seven other enslaved men took two horses and a wagon from the Spencer estate and made their way to Wilmington, DE, where they were aided by Thomas Garrett, a Quaker businessman, abolitionist, and Underground Railroad agent. From Wilmington, the Trustys traveled to New Hope, PA and then New York City, where they settled and took the name Garnet. For more than 10 years slavecatchers pursued them, capturing Henry's mother, Henny and the seven other men. New York abolitionists purchased Henny's freedom in January of 1830. Henry would later become a famous abolitionist and preacher, and in February 1865, become the first black minister to preach to the U.S. House of Representatives. €œDarby€ the original farm site where the Trusty/Garnet family escaped is currently marked by a newly erected state historical marker, located at the intersection of Routes 290 and 291 on state highway property."

Participants receive a character card representing a historical figure and his/her position on the matters at hand. Cards include lines to be read aloud, as well as context that enable each visitor to forge a connection with their character. Audience members assume their parts, share their €œin character€ positions, and experience €œfirst hand€ the passion and fury of this meeting. Participants argue to either break the Fugitive Slave Law in an obedience to a €œHigher Law€, or comply with the Fugitive Slave Law to uphold €œConstitutional Law€ and ultimately vote on resolutions on how to proceed.

He used it until his death in Philadelphia in 1873. His wife, Harriet Lee Smith (c.1796-1880) continued to use the home in the summers, until her death in this house in August 1880. Next to it was one of the only summer resorts for free blacks, the Banneker House, opened in 1845, which soon became the hub of summer life for Philadelphia's black abolitionist and Underground Railroad leaders. Smith, born enslaved, purchased his freedom, and set up a very successful coal and lumber company in Columbia, Pennsylvania. Smith was helping enslaved people who reached Columbia, PA as early as 1840. Columbia, with a large free-black population and the main bridge across the Susquehanna River, was a key destination for many people fleeing slavery in Maryland and Virginia. Smith, and his friend, relative and business partner, William Whipper, provided aide to these freedom seekers, with Whipper becoming station master in Columbia. Even after Smith moved to Philadelphia in 1842, their coal and lumber company was an important part of the Underground Railroad. They built hidden compartments in the 22 rail cars they owned and safely transported hundreds of people to Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. This house remains much as it was in Smith's day. Although we don't know at this time if the house itself was used for UGRR activity, it is an excellent location to tell Smith's UGRR story. Currently it is a private residence, although not used, and the owners plan to open it to the public once renovated."

Living and working on a 300 acres plantation along the Bohemia River in Cecil County owned by Samuel, Abraham took advantage of the chaos and tension of the American Revolution to seize his liberty. On November 7, 1775, John Murray, the royal governor of Virginia and a Loyalist, declared martial law in that colony and proclaimed that any enslaved person who joined the British armed forces to fight American patriots would receive their freedom. Known as Lord Dunmore's Proclamation, the declaration struck alarm beyond Virginia and the Chesapeake, stoking fears of slave rebellions all over the Mid-Atlantic. Dunmore's tactic to weaken revolutionaries' resources inspired thousands of enslaved people to flee their enslavers. British ships controlled the Chesapeake Bay early in the war, and their raids on farms and plantations wreaked havoc on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. Patriot revolutionaries lost livestock, food stores, and enslaved labor. Abraham, with easy access to the Bay via the Bohemia and Elk Rivers, fled to the British brig Nesbitt, which had been conducting raids throughout the area. Abraham settled in Nova Scotia, Canada, after the war. Maryland's Department of Natural Resources now owns a portion of this former plantation, establishing a new park called Bohemia River State Park in 2018.

The Farmstead was initially preserved because of its association with General George Washington, who planned the Battle of Germantown while staying at the Wentz farm in October 1777. However, further research has revealed another vital aspect of the property's history; its association with Jack, who was one of two enslaved people living and working on the property between 1766 and 1774. He fled from the Farmstead twice in pursuit of liberty. Following both attempts Peter Wentz placed runaway slave advertisements in the Pennsylvania Gazette for his capture and return. After his first attempt, Jack was jailed in Burlington, N.J. before being returned to the Farmstead. After his second escape, he disappears from the historical record, leaving us questioning whether he found freedom. Using period tax records and newspaper advertisements to chronicle this important history at the Farmstead lends an excellent view into the existence of enslaved people in Pennsylvania as well as of inherent conflicts in the social structure that allowed the practice."

In the years leading up to the Civil War, the church became known as an abolitionist institution, both for the resolve of the congregation as a whole, and by the actions of individual leaders and members, most notably Hiram Foote (1808-1889) and Sylvester B. Peck (1811- 1893). This assertion is supported by organizational documents including governing body minutes, personal correspondence, memoirs, rosters, contemporary reports and histories comprised in part of first-person accounts. Some of this documentation suggests that the church itself provided a refuge for freedom seekers. This early commitment to the noble cause of the abolition of slavery and the Underground Railroad resonates throughout the congregation's history. The First Presbyterian Church of Racine continues to foster a steadfast commitment to social justice. As Rev.

However, the only resident to be identified in a specific incident was Benjamin Viercy, who was involved in the 1838 escape of a freedom seeker named Nelson from Mason County, Kentucky. The settlement was not only a place where freedom seekers sought refuge. Because it was populated by people of African descent, it also became a target for unscrupulous kidnappers.

Many of its residents provided assistance to freedom seekers, risking their own personal freedom, their reputations and their livelihood. Among these operatives was husband and wife, Dr. Bartholomew (1794-1871) and Lydia Morris Fussell (1804-1840), who purchased the Pines in 1827.

Most of the laborers were free Blacks and freedom seekers who had recently fled enslavement. The fort was the largest inland masonry fortification in North America and part of a complex system of defensive fortifications designed to protect the Union garrison from Confederate attack during the Civil War. Despite miserable working conditions and poor treatment, the recently enslaved, then called contrabands, recognized the significance of federal occupation. With no guarantees of freedom, thousands flooded into Nashville in search of protection and opportunity. Although they encountered disease, prejudice, hunger, and indifference, contrabands provided vital labor to the army for little or no pay. They worked as teamsters, woodcutters, cart drivers, stonemasons, cooks, laundresses, and nurses. Men recruited into colored regiments at Fort Negley served as guards along railroad lines and as frontline troops at the Battle of Nashville on December 15 and 16, 1864. Fort Negley has developed interpretive programs and projects highlighting the park as a birthplace of freedom. Considered hallowed ground by the local African American community and others, Fort Negley was recognized in 2019 as a Site of Memory as part of the UNESCO's Slave Route Project. "

Cummings later became an important agent on the UGRR. Numerous farms dotted Moccasin Bend shortly after the Cherokee Indians lost the territory in 1819, and Jacob Cummings was one of the enslaved people working there. The Federal Road, established in 1805, passed across Moccasin Bend to Brown's Ferry as a major trade route in the region. This road and ferry site served as the escape route for Cummings and likely many other freedom seekers in the antebellum period. Cummings' journey was not without incident. He was captured multiple times, but escaped. He lived in Indiana for a year, where he attended school. He next moved to Michigan and, after four years on the run, he crossed the river to Canada. Cummings met Henry Bibb, another freedom seeker from Kentucky. Cummings eventually became an agent on the UGRR operating out of the DePuce settlement in Ontario. He remained in Canada until the outbreak of the Civil War. After the war, he moved to Columbus, Ohio, where he was interviewed by historian Wilbur Siebert in 1894 for Siebert's groundbreaking 1898 book, ""The Underground Railroad from Slavery to Freedom."""

Over the next 100 years, they and their descendants formed militias that were integral in defending the fort and the city from multiple British invasions. Without their efforts, St. Augustine and the Castillo may very well have fallen to the enemy. St. Augustine continued to be a haven for freedom seekers until 1790, when the King bowed to pressure from the U.S. and ended the sanctuary policies.

A few months later, an enslaved couple seeking freedom were allowed to stay, and the fort, which remained in Union control throughout the war, became the destination for countless freedom seekers fleeing slavery from the Gulf Coast of the Confederacy. In 1864, elements of the 25th United States Colored Troops marched into the fort. From Fort Pickens, these black soldiers fought to defend the Union and destroy slavery.

Tour stops highlight the important roles Quakers, African Americans, and other abolitionists played in the area's Underground Railroad. Two routes converged in Vandalia, Michigan in the mid-1800s: The ""Quaker line"" from the Ohio River and Kentucky and the ""Illinois line"" from St. Louis and the Mississippi River. The Quakers, had moved to the area around 1830, and acted as stationmasters and conductors. One of the most noteworthy events that happened was the 1847 Kentucky Slave Raid, which achieved national attention and resulted in prosecution of Underground Railroad operatives under the 1793 Fugitive Slave Law. The raid involved many of these UGRR stations, as well as other sites, which are featured on this tour. As was the pattern in other locations, African American settlement developed in proximity to the Quaker settlement. These African Americans who had achieved their freedom through both legal and extra-legal means, helped others to secure their freedom.
The tour has been operated by the Underground Railroad Society of Cass County (URSCC), a 501c3, since 2011. The mission of the URSCC is to research and educate the public about the Underground Railroad in Cass County MI, and to preserve and restore local UGRR sites as focal points for telling this story

A brief time later, he returned to Adrian, Michigan, attending the integrated and coeducational Haviland Institute the winter term of 1845. That summer, he sought help from Quaker Levi Coffin in Indiana to rescue his wife and children in bondage in Kentucky. After several disappointing months on the Ohio River, White returned alone, continuing his education.
In 1847, hoping to earn money to fund another rescue attempt, he found work nearby on the farm of Royal Watkins in Brooklyn, Michigan [listed in the NTF]. However, his slaveholder arrived with a plan to kidnap him, but with help from Laura Haviland, Royal Watkins, and other citizens, the armed Kentuckians' plans were foiled and White was not recaptured.
After his narrow escape, White dared another rescue of his family. Unsuccessful, White was captured and imprisoned. Abolitionists paid his fine and White settled in Canada where he remarried and started a new family. By 1860, he and his family had returned to Michigan, residing in various places in the southeastern part of the state and eventually settling in Ann Arbor. Here he resided on the same street where the home of Underground Railroad operative Rev. Guy Beckley was located [listed in the NTF].
In 1905, John Felix White passed away in his daughter's home in Oakland County, but was buried in Fairview Cemetery, located near his former home in Ann Arbor.

Established in the late 18th century and believed to be the earliest Black church established west of the Alleghenies, Macedonia Missionary Baptist Church, in Burlington, Ohio, played an important role in the Underground Railroad. Situated at Ohio's southernmost point, in Lawrence County, across the Ohio River from Virginia (now West Virginia), the area was a haven for Blacks who had been born free, emancipated by their slaveholders, or self-emancipated by escaping on the Underground Railroad. Sometime between 1811 and 1813, after a period of worshipping in their homes, the congregation constructed a small church. Through the mid-19th century, the black population of the area continued to grow. In 1849, a group of emancipated slaves known as the €œBurlington 37,€ settled into the community and helped build the church on Macedonia Hill, which currently stands. The church was the religious and social focal point of the area. The church's leadership and members assisted freedom seekers in a variety of ways, even welcoming them to reside in the community. The church also had strong, frequently familial connections, to other free Black communities in the region that were active on the Underground Railroad. Macedonia was the €œMother Church€ of other Black Baptist churches that formed the Providence Anti-Slavery Baptist Association, all of which carried out Underground Railroad work.
Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the church no longer has an active congregation. "

As its name suggests, the cemetery was associated with the (African) Union Baptist Church, which was organized in 1831, making it the second oldest African American church in the city.
In the years before the Civil War, many black people escaping slavery from the south, travelled the Underground Railroad through Cincinnati. The travelers depended upon the assistance of local blacks to help them on their journey. Members of three local black churches, which included Union Baptist Church provided a safe haven for those seeking freedom.
While the church is no longer in its location from the period of the Underground Railroad, the cemetery remains and is the final resting place of many individuals who were freedom seekers themselves and/or assisted with the movement. Some of the people of note are: husband and wife Rev. Peter Farley Fossett (1815-1901) and Sarah Mayrant Walker Fossett (1826-1906) and other members of the Fossett Family, Rev. Philip B. Ferguson (1824-1909), William P. Newman (1815-1866), Rev. David Leroy Nickens (1794-1838), Rev. Wallace Shelton (1810-1890), Susan Tinsely (1818-1903), and the Troy Family.
The efforts of these individuals in the Underground Railroad movement have been documented in newspaper articles, letters, and books.

Esther's fate after her escape is not known. Esther's story not only brings to light the Underground Railroad on Martha's Vineyard, but the enslavement of native peoples in colonial America.

The group of freedom seekers included Susan Borders, her sons Jarrot, Anderson, and Harrison, and another woman named Hannah Morrison. Captured in Knox County in early September, the freedom seekers were taken to Knoxville and held in the Knox County Jail. Eventually, Andrew Borders came north to retrieve them. While he acknowledged that Hannah was free, he claimed the other four as his indentured servants. Lacking proof of his claim, he returned south to get it. When he came back in November, he captured the children with the help of the sheriff. Susan was convinced by Galesburg abolitionists that they could get the children back and subsequently escaped to Galesburg. The children were held briefly in the jail, but the sheriff got them out and returned them to Randolph County. Between November 1842 and June 1844 charges and countercharges were heard in the Knox County Courthouse against Borders and against Knox County abolitionists for assisting in Susan's escape. Ultimately, none of the accused on either side were found guilty.

UGRR ""Wax Museum In A Box""€ is a project-based learning program for 5th graders. The 5-step program introduces the Underground Railroad with a focus on Cass County, Michigan. Cass County was an important stop on the Underground Railroad. Quakers, African Americans, and other abolitionists played in the area's Underground Railroad. Two routes converged in Vandalia, Michigan in the mid-1800s: The ""Quaker line"" from the Ohio River and Kentucky and the ""Illinois line"" from St. Louis and the Mississippi River. The Quakers, had moved to the area around 1830, and served as important Underground Railroad operatives. One of the most noteworthy events that happened was the 1847 Kentucky Slave Raid, which achieved national attention and resulted in prosecution of Underground Railroad operatives under the 1793 Fugitive Slave Law. As was the pattern in other locations, African American settlement developed in proximity to the Quaker settlement. These African Americans who had achieved their freedom through both legal and extra-legal means, helped others to secure their freedom. As part of the program, students are given the opportunity to use their research, writing, and performance skills to develop a portrayal of a documented Cass County Underground Railroad activist and present as part of the Wax Museum at the Bonine House.

One of the largest iron furnaces during the eighteenth century, its operation was conceived by its original owner, Caleb Dorsey, a prominent tobacco plantation owner, to maximize profits using a combination of enslaved, indentured, and convict labor. The furnace operated using this unfree labor system from 1755 until 1822. Work at Elk Ridge Furnace was brutal, and punishments were severe. At least five people enslaved at the Furnace have been documented attempting to escape these violent conditions, in cases that appeared as runaway advertisements in 18th century newspapers throughout the mid-Atlantic. In several cases, individuals escaped multiple times, suffering severe punishments and persisting in pursuit of freedom. This site highlights several underrepresented components of Underground Railroad history. It represents resistance to industrial slavery, which has received less robust public interpretation than more wellknown
depictions of enslavement, such as plantation slavery and domestic servitude. It provides evidence of eighteenth-century freedom seekers, whose efforts to escape have had less historic documentation than later cases. Finally, it follows several cases in detail and considers the strategies that individuals used to escape and collaborate with one another."

As the first public monument to commemorate Black soldiers, this memorial symbolizes the beginning of the large-scale inclusion of African Americans in the waging of the Civil War. Through their heroic assault on Fort Wagner, South Carolina, the 54th Regiment, forever enshrined in this beautiful memorial, helped inspire the enlistment of nearly 200,000 African Americans, including many formerly enslaved freedom seekers, into the war effort.

Members of the Hicks, Mackall, and Brome families enslaved Africans and African Americans on the site from 1753-1864, with John Mackall, Jr. presiding over the property at the time of the escape. On April 2, 1814, Admiral Cockburn issued a proclamation of emancipation for all enslaved Marylanders and their families who would either enlist with the British or agree to settle in British territories. Although primarily a military expediency, the proclamation temporarily broke John Mackall Jr.'s hold over the enslaved people then held on the site. Between April and August of 1814, nineteen enslaved individuals made their way from Mackall's plantation to British lines on nearby St. George's Island, in the Potomac River. After boarding a British warship, some of Mackall's former bondsmen, including Harry Hammett and €œLittle Harry,€ joined Cockburn's newly founded Corps of Colonial Marines. Once the War of 1812 ended in American victory all nineteen freedom seekers settled in Trinidad andNova Scotia. A recent multi-year research effort by St. Mary's College of Maryland revealed that their current athletic fields stand on land that formerly comprised the then-Mackall Plantation. Accordingly, with the dedication of a commemorative installation to enslaved freedom seekers from St. Mary's County in November of 2020, the athletic fields have become the primary point of interpretation and visitation for the plantation site.

The farmlandwas purchased fromabolitionist Gerrit Smith and occupied by Mary A. Brown and the younger Brown children from 1849 until 1860. For much of his adult life, John Brown was dedicated to ending slavery in the United States using violent means, and for this he was ultimately hanged by the US government after the raid at Harper’s Ferry, VA. But John Brown had a lifelong connection to providing assistance to freedom seekers. A Calvinist in religious faith,John Brown modeled for his family the equality of all people, and the rest of the family put into practice Brown’s passion for assisting his Black neighbors. The period of ownership and residence at the North Elba farm coincided with long absences by the patriarch. Brown himself only lived here for 6 non-consecutive months.1It was during the period of ownership that Brown went to Kansas with his older sons; leading violent campaigns against pro-slavery forces in the Pottawatomie Massacre in May of 1856 and other violent episodes known collectively as “Bleeding Kansas”andin leading a small group of 18-22 men in the raid on the armory at Harpers Ferry, Virginia in 1859, which was to raise an armed rebellion of the enslaved. He was buried on the property in early December 1859. The cemetery was expanded after the period of the Brown family ownership. Beginning in the 1870s,when the John Brown Association lead by Kate Field purchased the property and allowed pilgrimage and expansion of the burial site to include family members and others killed at Harper’s Ferry."

John Brown’s list of anti-slavery activities is long, but he is most well-known for fighting slave-supporters in Kansas (Bleeding Kansas) and for attempting to lead a slave revolt starting with attacking the arsenal at Harpers Ferry in 1859. This event contributed to the Civil War. John Brown lived in three houses in Richfield and hid slaves in his cellar of his home on West Streetsboro Road. This house, his third in Richfield, is still standing and being nominated for inclusion on the NPS Network to Freedom based on John Brown’s life work in support of freeing enslaved people and its use as an Underground Railroad station in 1843. Eunice Merton, respected Richfield historian and journalist, recorded this event as related by Jennie Oviatt with details from her grandparents, Mason and Jennie Oviatt, confirmed abolitionists.

enslaved Black Louisville community in 1830s and ‘40s. St. Louis is an active cemetery on 43
acres that contains nearly 50,000 burials. In the 1850s the Smiths moved from Louisville onto a 40-acre farm in Jennings County in the
free state of Indiana. Their small community of free Blacks, 30 miles north of the Ohio River,
had been an UGRR stop for at least two decades on one of the busiest routes of enslaved
freedom seekers."

seekers and served as a meeting house where anti-slavery lectures and civil rights activities were held. The most celebrated member

of the Salem Chapel is the legendary UGRR conductor, Harriet Tubman. After the US government passed the 1850 Fugitive Slave

Act, she extended her UGRR route to St. Catharines and worshipped at the Salem Chapel. In 1868, when Tubman was interviewed

In addition, the park’s natural resources include thousands of acres of waterways including portions of the St. Johns and Nassau rivers. These water corridors were the route people traveled in their effort to find freedom.  Due to the broad geographic area of the park and the complex history, the park is able to tell several different stories about freedom seekers, including the accounts of the carpenters and coopers of St. Johns Town in the British period, the Guerrero survivors in 1829, Charles and Dorcas in 1835, Romeo Murray in 1843, James and Pattie during the Civil War and others who sought liberty from various locations within Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve."

Nestled in the delta at the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, freedom seekers had historically seen the river town as a staging point to acquire their freedom further north.  As the Civil War intensified, migration to Cairo came by escape through the Underground Railroad, by military contraband camps, or on the contraband train after the battle of Shiloh.  The contraband camp served as a military recruitment center for freedom seekers to enlist with the U.S. army and for others to find paid jobs to support their family. By 1863, the Contraband Camp established housing, a hospital and school to support thousands of refugees who sought freedom during the war.  The camp at Cairo activated the work of many abolitionists, including Marie Renfro and Laura Haviland, as well and the collaboration the African Methodist Church to provide support of the overwhelming numbers of refugees. Although very little remains of the contraband camp that was a beacon of freedom for so many refugees during the Civil War, the site of the camp remains a landmark that commemorates the lives of thousands of freedom seekers making a way out of no way."

Constructed in 1871, the church bears witness to its roots, which are traced back to the 1850s. In that tumultuous period, ""Uncle Perry Hinson"" erected a small structure in a secluded woods beyond the town for free and enslaved people. This modest sanctuary served as a refuge for worship, education, fellowship, and the pursuit of equality. As the only place where Black people could gather locally, faith and kinship aided freedom seekers such as Edward Richardson. This haven had unparalleled significance in southern Cecil County, where 35 percent of the population were people of color, nearly half of whom were enslaved. Despite facing violence and opposition from White patrols in the antebellum period and later ""Klu Kluxers"" in the immediate post-war years, worshippers persisted in defying chattel slavery. Today, Union Bethel's origins are deeply rooted in this antebellum era, characterized by defiant resistance, its foundation beginning with the little sanctuary tucked away in the woods."

Living in a border state, these families were caught between the conflict of both Union Troops and Confederate guerilla soldiers. Under Martial law, many Missourians strongly opposed the formation of Colored Troops, only allowing those enslaved to serve as substitutes in their place and to fill County quotas. These freedom seekers, like many others, escaped slavery by the underground railroad, enlisting without permission. Slave Patrols, who kept constant watch of the roads for those attempting freedom, would either return those seeking their freedom to their former enslaver or enforce methods of punishment, which could include death.

The Mexican Army ambushed and fired upon slave catchers at Mission San Jose. The slave catchers were hoping to kidnap and re-enslave freedom seekers from Louisiana who were thought to be in the area. The slave catchers were then imprisoned in the nearby jail. Later in 1859, following the annexation of Texas when San Antonio was a part of the United States, Mission San Jose was identified by an enslaver as a potential stopping site of freedom seekers recently escaping his nearby plantation. He identified the Mission San Jose community as a potential source of support.

Though few physical traces remain of the people enslaved at Button Farm—except for a suspected slave cemetery and the natural environment itself—the tour uses 19th century artifacts, architecture and agriculture, alongside newly discovered historical accounts, to illuminate the story of freedom seekers and the impact that they had on local enslaved communities and the abolitionist movement at large. While Button Farm was not a stop on the Underground Railroad, its landscape and surviving cultural resources help to visualize an active corridor of escape that ran through the surrounding community."

Her story begins on the hot summer morning as a young child, is sold away from her parents, sold three times in a span of years, has her children sold away one day as she was in the field. Her story is a universal story as it happened many times over to countless individuals. In the portrayal, she tells her story with a physicality and nervous movements. She sometimes uses humor as she lets you in on secrets from her enslaver. Some of the incidents she recalls, you laugh and cry with her in pain. This constructed life is mined from slave narratives of many different sources.

Lila is smart, a survivor, she makes a world with what she needs with courage, intelligence and cunning, all while the idea of freedom is in the upper part of her mind. As her narrative unwinds, she manifests agency in freeing herself. She doesn’t know where freedom is or how long it will take to get there, but she know what happens if she can’t make it and yet she stands waiting on a boat to cross the river to freedom."

Directed by head waiter John W. Morrison, the hotel’s all-Black waitstaff assisted hundreds of freedom seekers before the American Civil War. Both African Americans and African Canadians were employed seasonally at the Cataract. Many of them were born in Southern states. Some freedom seekers who fled via the Cataract House were enslaved by Southern hotel guests. Others were African American refugees who reached the “fluid frontier” of the Great Lakes Basin and needed help crossing to free soil. They were transported across the Niagara River by ferry, or in small boats rowed by Cataract House waiters, including Morrison himself. After the Suspension Bridge opened to rail traffic in 1855, they also traveled by train. Reaching the Canadian side, freedom seekers were protected by African Canadians, who sent them on to places of greater security and more employment. Such Underground Railroad operations continued for more than two decades, despite a series of sensational rescues that took place. Exemplary of Black agency and resistance, Underground Railroad activism at the Cataract House Site also demonstrates the binational character of antislavery operations in the Niagara River borderlands."
