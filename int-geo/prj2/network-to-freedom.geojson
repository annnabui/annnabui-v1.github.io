    "ABSTRACT":"Constructed between 1829 and 1847, Fort Pulaski was created as part of a national defense system designed to safeguard important cities and ports along the eastern coast of America from foreign attack. On January 3, 1861, Georgia State troops took possession of the federal fort with orders from the governor to \"hold it against all persons.\" On April 10, 1862, Union forces, under the command of Major General David Hunter, demanded the unconditional surrender of the fort. Confederate Colonel Charles H. Olmstead refused the demand, and the two sides soon began exchanging cannon fire. After 30 hours of battle, the Union forces prevailed and took possession of the fort. After the victory, Gen. Hunter announced in General Order No. 7, that: \"All persons of color lately held to involuntary service by enemies of the United States in Fort Pulaski and on Cockspur Island, Georgia, are hereby confiscated and declared free, in conformity with the law, and shall here after receive the fruits of their own labor.\" This order was issued approximately eight months before Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation. Until the end of the Civil War, Fort Pulaski served as a destination for enslaved people attempting to reach freedom. It also played an important role as a recruitment station for freed African American males who wanted to serve in one of the nation's first black regiments, the First South Carolina Volunteer Infantry."

    "ABSTRACT":"Contemporary reminisces and local tradition maintain that the East Nishnabotna Ferry crossing outside of Lewis, Iowa (Cass County) was utilized by freedom seekers and their guides on the Underground Railroad during the late 1850s. The ferry crossing was on the main state/post road between Des Moines [east] and Kanesville (Council Bluffs) [west]. This portion of the road was on the Jim Lane Trail and the Tabor to Springdale route of the Underground Railroad across Iowa. It was the only way to cross the river for many miles in both directions. One noteworthy incident occurred in February 1859, as John Brown, with the help of others, transported a dozen freedom seekers across the ferry. The river crossing is an appropriate place to commemorate this association with the Underground Railroad in Southwestern Iowa. Today, the Nishnabotna Ferry House property is owned by a local historical association. It is located across the river, approximately a quarter mile east of the George B. Hitchcock House. The ferry keeper's house is the only remaining structure from the period."

    "ABSTRACT":"The name \"Constitution Hall\" was given to the two-story building, with a basement at this site. Construction began April 1855. It soon became the official headquarters for the \"Topeka Movement\", \"code name\" for the then illegal activities acting against the Pro Slavery laws. John H. Kagi who died at Harpers Ferry with John Brown, was a reporter for the Tribune located here. Joseph Miller, the treasurer for the Topeka Underground Railroad lived and had a tin shop and stored supplies in the basement. Rev. Lewis Bodwell, preacher for the Congregational Church and a major conductor of freedom seekers used the facility. Armstrong, organizer for the Underground Railroad in Shawnee County also used the facility. The building being the only substantial one in the embryo city became the hub for the political, military, religious, economic, educational, social, commercial, and safety center for citizens and fugitives during the period in Kansas history known as \"Bleeding Kansas\". The Free State Capitol building of Kansas (1864-1870) encapsulated old Constitution Hall and expanded it by extensions on each end. It contained all the offices for the newly organized state government and was used until after the Civil War when funds were appropriated to construct the present more prestigious building."

Corroborating written reminiscences and oral tradition, preserved in the museum's collections, provide evidence for the Homestead's role as a station on the Underground Railroad in the mid-nineteenth century. Members of the Jackson family, including William and his brother Francis, were active participants in the abolition movement in the Boston area. The house was donated to the city of Newton in 1949 by a Jackson descendant and opened as a museum in 1950. As a nationally accredited museum today, the Homestead offers a wide range of public programs and exhibitions including interpretive ongoing and annual programs on the Underground Railroad and abolition. The Jackson Homestead is a site on the National Underground Railroad Millennium Trail and is included in the Library of Congress' Local Legacies Project as an Underground Railroad site."

Sitting atop a hill, this house was the site of many abolitionist meetings and a stop on the Underground Railroad. It is reported that it was here that William and Ellen Craft hid after the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act in early November 1851. Samuel Philbrick was one of Brookline's first and most active abolitionists. The Grimke sisters spent the winter of 1837 here with the Philbrick family. Philbrick was also the treasurer of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society. According to one source, \"Samuel Philbrick alone kept the spark of anti-slavery feeling alive in that very conservative community.\" He was also a friend and financial backer of William Lloyd Garrison and The Liberator from 1831 on."

A colonial farmhouse at the start of the American Revolution in 1775, and home to Samuel Whitney, Muster Master of the Concord Minute Men as well as at least two enslaved Africans. The Alcott family home from 1845 to 1848; it sheltered at least one freedom seeker that can be documented. Mrs. Alcott's family included Judge Samuel Sewall, who wrote an early anti-slavery tract, \"The Selling of Joseph\" in 1700, and her brother, Samuel J. May, was a founder of The American Anti-Slavery Society and a conductor on the Underground Railroad in Syracuse, New York. Later, The Wayside was the only home Nathaniel Hawthorne and his family ever owned and was home to publisher Daniel Lothrop and his wife, Harriet M. Lothrop, better known as Margaret Sidney, who wrote The Five Little Peppers and How They Grew. Each of these literary families made additions to the house. Now the Wayside is a National Historic Landmark in Minute Man Historical Park. It is often referred to as \"The Home of Authors\"."

The house was bought by William Ingersoll Bowditch who became a leading abolitionist in the Boston anti-slavery movement. Number 9 Toxteth was the site of local abolitionist meetings as well as a stop on the Underground Railroad. Freedom seekers and the son of John Brown were secreted here on their way to freedom. Bowditch helped form the Boston Vigilance Committee on October 15, 1850. Bowditch, along with his friend Philbrick, was the most avid abolitionist in Brookline. Neither voted, except for the town offices, not agreeing with the Constitution. Bowditch, unable to support the Constitution, resigned his office of United States Commissioner. Mr. Bowditch also hosted the Smith Colored School of Boston at his Toxteth house."

    "ABSTRACT":"By the mid 1850s, Forks of the Road was the Deep South's second largest market for the selling of enslaved African Americans. It was the destination for major and minor traders from Virginia, Georgia, Florida, the Carolinas, Missouri, Tennessee, and Kentucky. The Forks of the Road site was used by Franklin and Armfield, the notorious owners of the Alexandria and Natchez Markets, along with countless smaller dealers. As Union troops pushed the Confederacy out of the region during the Civil War,  Forks of the Road became an encampment for the Natchez US Colored Troops (USCT) stationed at Fort McPherson. Many of these self-emancipated soldiers had once been confined within the Fork of the Roads \"slave pens.\" In early 1864, members of the 58th Regiment US Colored Infantry (USCI) helped in dismantling the notorious structure to obtain lumber for the building of barracks. The formerly enslaved tore down the structure with \"great enthusiasm\" and \"terrible earnestness,\" according to a contemporary newspaper article."

    "ABSTRACT":"Farmstead in the Town of Newfane, New York, owned by Charles and Libby McCLew in 1850. Extensive, long-standing local folklore identifies the McClews as \"station masters\" of the Underground Railroad. The farmstead remains virtually unchanged and is still a privately-owned working farm enterprise. All grounds and facilities are open year-round to the public. Guided Underground Railroad tours and presentations have been developed and conducted for over ten years. Tours include walking trails through a 30-acre \"wilderness\" area on the farm which has been dedicated to this purpose. Hopkins Creek, which flows through the property, is believed to have been an important geographic feature used to navigate towards other safe havens and ultimately to Canada. A10x12-foot chamber under the barn (probably built as a cistern) is believed to have been used as a hiding place by people escaping from slavery for many years. The entrance to the chamber and all interpretive displays are accessible for viewing to all visitors. Underground Railroad reenactments have been conducted and filmed on site, and segments have been shown throughout New York State by PBS Television and will be distributed this year by the State University of New York to all public and private schools in New York State. An archeological study of the site is in progress, concentrating on the significance of cultural material uncovered parallel with the period of the Underground Railroad, and on collected folklore and oral history from the local community indicting the use of the farm as an Underground Railroad \"station.\" Public displays have been developed, are continually expanded, and will incorporate exhibits of archeological methods, artifacts and of the significance of cultural anthropological studies and oral traditions to historical research of the Underground Railroad."

    "ABSTRACT":"The John P. Parker house in Ripley, Ohio was the home of a formerly enslaved African who purchased his freedom and became a crusader to abolish slavery with his courageous work as a conductor on the Underground Railroad. With only one documented exception, Parker did not hide freedom seekers at his Front Street property, but he lived and worked there at his iron foundry, starting as early as 1853. Rather than playing a role as an abolitionist speaker or activist in anti-slavery societies, Parker is significant for his unflagging and often heroic efforts to rescue freedom seekers from across the Ohio River, frequently returning to Kentucky to lead freedom seekers to safety. Parker's story is recorded in an autobiography His Promised Land. In addition to his work with the Underground Railroad, Parker is important as an inventor who earned three patents in the 19th century. His restored home is a National Historic Landmark and an Official Project of Save America's Treasures."

It was built by Milton's founder, Joseph Goodrich, a staunch abolitionist and member of the Seventh Day Baptist Church. Goodrich also constructed a dirt tunnel between the inn and the 1837 log cabin to the rear of the inn. Goodrich secretly harbored freedom seekers in the cellar of the Milton House using the tunnel as the exit and entrance to the cellar. Here he and his family would provide assistance to the freedom seekers. Goodrich and his family also conducted freedom seekers to other stops as they continued the journey toward the Great Lakes and on to Canada."

    "ABSTRACT":"Joshua Glover, a freedom seeker, lived and worked in Racine for two years before he was captured in 1854 and jailed in Milwaukee. In Racine, a gathering in the square sent a delegation to Milwaukee, which joined Milwaukee citizens to break open the jail and free Glover. He shuttled on the Underground Railroad throughout Southeastern Wisconsin and finally escaped through Racine harbor on a ship for Canada. Later, a newspaper editor, Sherman Booth, was sentenced and jailed for violating the fugitive slave law for helping Glover. The Wisconsin Supreme Court nullified that law and refused to conform with Federal law. The eventual formation of the Republican Party was also accelerated by the Glover incident. Today in Racine, the Glover story has been celebrated and re-enacted. The Racine Heritage Museum has had a permanent exhibit about Glover, the Underground Railroad, and the Civil War era in Racine County. The section about Glover and the Underground Railroad was significantly expanded."

The great nineteenth century leader Frederick Douglass was a freedom seeker and a conductor on the Underground Railroad, as well as being the author of three autobiographies and the editor of three newspapers. His newspapers published articles on freedom seekers and championed the cause of abolition of slavery. Cedar Hill was Douglass' last home and the site where he wrote his third autobiography. After Douglass escaped from slavery in Maryland, Douglass lived in New Bedford, Massachusetts, and then Rochester, New York. After his escape, Douglass quickly became an orator making the life of a bondsman real to a multitude of audiences. In Rochester his home became a station on the Underground Railroad, and he published his newspapers, the most famous of which was The North Star."

The Todd House and Tabor, Iowa were a meeting place for many of the leading abolitionists in the United States during the 1850's, such as: John Brown, James Lane, and Samuel Gridley Howe. It was also a stop on the famed Jim Lane trail. The Todd House is one of only four registered stops on the Underground Railroad in Iowa, and it is certified by the National Park Service and the National Register of Historic Places. The Reverend Todd and the colony at Tabor were dedicated to the proposition that everyone including women and people of color deserved an equal opportunity for a college education. They started a college in Tabor that espoused those beliefs. Inside the Todd House is a museum that has many visitors each year especially children on school visits. The Todd house has been featured on Iowa Public Television in connection with educational programs on the Underground Railroad.

    "ABSTRACT":"Camp Warren Levis, a current day portion of the area known as Rocky Fork in Godfrey, Illinois was one of the first \"Free\" state stops for slaves escaping Missouri as early as 1816. The area continued to serve in this capacity as an Underground Railroad stop and escapee community until well after the Missouri Emancipation Proclamation of 1865. Various family stories, community memories and documents attest to the significance of the area. Since 1921, part of the Rocky Fork area has been used as a Boy Scout Camp however, evidence still exists of the escapees and their helpers."

It was the home of the Denham and Lovejoy families for nearly 100 years (1838-1931). Reverend Owen Lovejoy was its most famous resident and occupied the house from 1838-1864. He was an outspoken abolitionist and openly proclaimed his willingness to assist fugitive slaves. His involvement made this house one of the most important stations on the Underground Railroad in Illinois. The Owen Lovejoy Home now belongs to the City of Princeton and was opened as a museum in 1972. The United States Secretary of the Interior declared the property a National Historic Landmark in 1997."

    "ABSTRACT":"Kimzey Crossing, formerly known as Locust Hill, was the home of Benajah Guernsey Roots, civil engineer, educator, agriculturist and abolitionist, who moved from Connecticut to Illinois in 1837. Initially settling in Shaweentown, Roots soon relocated to a 1200-acre farm south of Tamaroa, where he built a five-room log cabin, began Locust Hill Academy, and, according to family tradition, began aiding runaway slaves. The current 12-room mansion was built along the Shawneetown to St. Louis trail between 1854 and 1856. Benajah G. Roots' documented involvement in Underground Railroad activity stems from his physical and protracted intervention in the case of freedom-seeker Jim Gray in October 1859, as Roots sought through legal redress to prevent Gray's kidnapping by slave catchers. Roots presented testimony regarding the Gray incident as a defense witness in the Chicago trial of John Hossack in February 1860. B. G. Roots' participation in the Gray incident tends to lend credence to oft repeated family tradition that Roots was active in the Underground Railroad and that his Locust Hill property served as a station (both the original log-cabin, no longer extant, the 1850s mansion), and as a small post-Emancipation settlement and burial ground for former freedom seekers. Unfortunately, extensive twentieth century alterations to the property's landscape, buildings and structures have destroyed these purported hiding places and habitations."

The project has developed into a cohesive, diverse group working to locate, verify, protect, preserve, and promote those Indiana sites and routes involved in the Underground Railroad (UGRR). IFT members dedicate themselves and their resources to the research, education, interpretation, and reverence of Indiana's UGRR heritage for the benefit of future generations. The group includes representatives of state agencies, historical societies, and libraries, along with private individuals; all of whom are volunteers. Volunteers work within their regions to research the sites in their area, then the group places these regional sites into statewide context and how the sites and individuals are related. The group is beginning to work with researchers in other states to connect Indiana's sites with other state's sites."

    "ABSTRACT":"The primary goal of this program is to assist the public in its understanding of the flight and plight of runaway slaves as they crossed the Ohio River into Floyd County, Indiana, prior to and throughout the Civil War period. Floyd County is in a very unique spot in that it stretches thirteen miles along the Ohio River across from Louisville, Kentucky. There were, therefore, border problems and ensuing complications for slaves who attempted to cross the river through this metropolitan area. Slave catchers and police worked together and easily crossed the river using the ferry and railroad systems. Therefore, escape through this area was very difficult. Newspapers frequently reported on capture of runaway slaves in this southern Indiana region. This program conveys the problems but also gives documented examples of slaves who were able to escape through Floyd County on their own as well as with the help of local citizens. The free African American community was primarily responsible for assistance, but help also came from white, anti-slavery church members.\n\nThe program also emphasizes the fact that the Underground Railroad was still in operation in this area after President Lincoln gave the Emancipation Proclamation. Because Kentucky was a Union state, the proclamation did not apply to Kentucky slaves. Many slaves ignored that fact, however. Between January 1, 1863, and the end of the Civil War, Floyd County was flooded with fugitives from slavery. The Indiana Exclusion Act of 1851 was not rescinded until 1866. That coupled with the fact that bias against blacks continued to exist, meant that benevolent activity of any kind toward runaway slaves and contraband families had to be suppressed. The program manager makes use of overhead transparencies and shares her extensive research of census records, church and court records, newspapers and oral histories."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Nathan and Polly Johnson House at 21 Seventh Street, New Bedford, Massachusetts was designated as a National Historical Landmark in 2000. This site played a significant role as a station on the Underground Railroad. The 21 Seventh Street home of Nathan and Mary (Polly) was not only the first home of fugitive Frederick Douglass and his wife, after his 1838 escape from slavery. The house is documented to have housed at least one other fugitive slave and is purported to have been a haven for many others. Douglass' intellect and temperament surely inclined him toward anti-slavery work, but Nathan Johnson and New Bedford provided him an example and opportunity to grow into one of the most effective and renowned abolitionists of his time. Frederick Douglass was Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey and had begun to use the surname, Johnson when he arrived in New Bedford in September of 1838 and Nathan Johnson persuaded him to choose a less common name. Nathan Johnson was reading Lady of the Lake by Sir Walter Scott and suggested he adopt the name, Douglas(s) after the lead character in the book."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Guy Beckley House is significant as an anti-slavery center and station on the Underground Railroad from 1842, when Beckley move onto the property, until his death in 1847. In those brief years, Beckley worked tirelessly to sway public opinion through sermons, lectures, articles and participation in political reforms.\n\nRev. Beckley lectured as a commissioned agent of the American Anti-Slavery Society in New England, moved to Michigan in 1839 and immediately resumed his anti-slavery activities. A member of the Michigan Anti-Slavery Society Executive Committee from 1840, Beckley served as Vice-President in 1845. From 1841-1847 Beckley co-published the anti-slavery newspaper and national Liberty Party voice, Signal of Liberty. Biographical slave accounts offered justification for Northerners to assist runaways. In addition to articles arousing abolitionist sympathy, Beckley wrote about assisting slaves. Conductor Lyman Goodnow's account mentions stopping at Beckley's along the Wisconsin to Canada journey with runaway Caroline Quarlls. Other reminiscences and stories identify Guy Beckley, stationmaster.\n\nThe Guy Beckley House, nearly unchanged in appearance since 1844, is the most prominent Underground Railroad site in Ann Arbor, a center of anti-slavery activism in Michigan and home of the man who sacrificed his time, financial security and health to the Cause."

    "ABSTRACT":"In the early hours of May 21, 1855, a party of enslaved Africans boarded a skiff on the Mississippi riverfront north of St. Louis. Their goal was freedom; their immediate destination, Illinois, the free state across the river. Newspapers articles published over the next five days indicate that the freedom-seekers were met on the Illinois shore by police officers and owners. Freeman, one of the organizers on the Illinois side, died of the wounds he received that night; another organizer, Mary Meachum, widow of the pastor of the First African Baptist Church of St. Louis, was arrested; Esther, one of the freedom-seekers, was sold \"down river.\" A bicyclist pausing at the spot today looks out on a scene only slightly altered from that lit by the lanterns that night. To the south, a rusting railway bridge replaces the ferry landing, but the site itself is vacant as it was then, largely untouched by the industrial development the bridge would bring. Its location on the river side of a pedestrian and bicycle trail assures that it will remain insulated from the industrial area that lies behind the levee. The 9-acre site is well-suited for re-enactments or other celebrations of the Freedom Crossing."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Bristol Hill Congregation Church, begun in 1832 and dedicated in 1835, was built in a Federal style, reflecting the New England origins and traditional values of its members. It stands on its original site at the highest point in the Town of Nolney, on the north side of State Route 3, three miles east of Fulton, New York. Except for the loss of its bell, the church is in virtually original condition. The Oswego County landfill encroaches 200 feet to the rear of the church, but otherwise the surrounding countryside retains its rural character. Many of the area's farmhouses were associated with church members and church activities.\n\nThis church is significant architecturally because it represents a simple, functional, and unostentatious Federal form common to many upstate congregations influenced by New England traditions. The pattern reflects the congregation's rural lifestyle and their commitment to traditional values, including ideals of Calvinism and republican virtue. The building also reflects the congregation's relatively modest means and suggests that they defined wealth in spiritual rather than material terms.\n\nThe Bristol Hill Church illustrates the history of the underground railroad, abolitionism, and African American life in central New York in three important ways:\n\n1. First, at least two families in this church participated in well-documented underground railroad activities. One family, that of Hiram and Lucy Gilbert, was European American. One family, that of Amos and Hannah Mason, was African American.\n\n2. From the 1820's on, this church had African American as well as European American members. Hannah Mason apparently became a member shortly after she migrated to Oswego County in 1825. Two daughters of Amos and Hannah Mason were baptized in this church in 1827. Amos Mason and James Watkins Seward joined in 1831. Isaac and Sally Lawson joined in 1832. Venus Slater, Silas Slater, two of Silas' sons, and A. (Andrew) and B. Slater were also "

The barn is now gone, although the Buckout residence still stands.\n\nCharles Smith, a former slave from Baltimore, Maryland, was a barber and tenant in the Buckout-Jones Building in 1857. He was a committed abolitionist, and an outspoken opponent of discrimination in all forms. Grant signed petitions, joined the City of Oswego Vigilance Committee, and enrolled his children in public schools despite discrimination from teachers and parents of white children.\n\nOwner Abram Buckout and tenants Charles Smith and Tudor E. Grant worked in this building, provided aid for fugitive slaves, and supported the cause of abolition."

Well-known abolitionists, they constructed what appears to be a hidden room or hiding place for slaves in the basement. Situated behind the furnace, one small window opens under the front steps, a 5\" x 8\" passthrough permits food exchange, and a low door permits actual entrance into the \"hidey hole\".\n\nWhile Clarke's interests ranged from history to law to horticulture, his anti-slavery activities must have absorbed most of his time. He attended numerous anti-slavery meetings, signed petitions, distributed anti-slavery tracts, and wrote letters the editor, attempted, at one point, to rescue a female slave off a canal boat. Clarke died in 1884 and was buried in Riverside Cemetery, Company Route 57; his grave marker reads: \"Just fearless human. He gave the best of his years and powers to the relief of the oppressed and to the aid and succous (sic) of slaves escaping from bondage, having in all he did the effective sympathy and cooperation of his devoted wife.\""

    "ABSTRACT":"The Gerrit Smith estate in Peterboro, New York, home to the well-known abolitionist Gerrit Smith (1797-1874), was a major resting-place for refugees from slavery throughout the antebellum period. The site has been termed \"the Grand Central Station of the Underground Railroad\" because of the number of African Americans who passed through Peterboro with help from Smith and his family. The estate was located at the junction of several Underground Railroad routes through central New York. From Peterboro, the well-traveled paths ran into Canada via Lewiston, Rochester, Sodus Point, Fairhaven, Oswego and Cape Vincent. According to primary documents, Smith's barn and kitchen were often used to house refugees.\n\nIn addition to Underground Railroad activities, Smith was a radical activist who made speeches, wrote essays, and donated money in the name of abolition. He led the New York Anti-Slavery Society in the 1830's, and eventually ran for state and national office on abolitionist tickets from 1840-1860. Smith used his wealth to purchase the freedom of enslaved African Americans and entertained numerous abolitionists who came to the estate to discuss pressing issues and plan political action. Some of those freed by Smith eventually worked for him at his estate."

Littlefield was closely allied with Gerrit Smith and Smith's land agent, John B. Edwards. This alliance supported not only Littlefield's business activities but also his involvement with abolitionism and the Freedom Trail.\n\nDocumentation for the use of Littlefield's house as a way station comes from three sources: a letter from Edwards to Smith; and oral tradition collected in the early 20th century and delivered in a DAR speech; and an oral tradition passed through the family of the minister of Edwards' church. Because Edwards' letter is a primary source, written by a person directly involved at the time of the events, the documentation for the Littlefield House as an Underground Railroad site is excellent. Though some exterior changes are evident, the house retains integrity of location, setting, feeling and association."

    "ABSTRACT":"As Gerrit Smith's land agent, friend and fellow abolitionist, John B. Edwards shaped Oswego's economic and cultural development for over sixty years. For at least sixteen of those years he was a key helper on the Freedom Trail, arranging passage across Lake Ontario for fugitive slaves on the very least part of their journey to Canada. Documentation for use of the Edwards' house as a stop on the Underground Railroad is remarkable, both for its detail and for the long time span it covers. The original Edwards letters to Smith which relate these underground activities are located in Bird Library, Syracuse University.\n\nEdwards purchased the house in 1836, two years after it was built, and owned it until his death in 1895. Greek Revival in style, the two-story building exhibits a gable end orientation to the street, post and beam construction, and a foundation of cut field stone. The modillions beneath the eaves are seen rarely in Oswego County. Before the Civil War, at the time of its greatest historic significance, the house was surrounded by open fields. After the war Edwards sold the adjoining parcels of Lot 108, Block 139; today the Edwards House sets on a 33' wide lot, surrounded by homes situated on similar small plots.\n\nFortunately, the John B. and Lydia Edwards House retains its original form on its original site, and a feeling and association related to its historic period. Were they to return today, the Edwards family would surely recognize the house as their own?"

The Square was the gathering place for abolition activities, as well as the locations for speeches by Frederick Douglass and Abraham Lincoln. At Independence Hall, the Declaration of Independence, promising freedom, was adopted, the US Constitution with its three-fifths rule and 20-year postponement of slavery discussion, was drafted, and the US District Court trials concerning the Christiana riots and other fugitive cases were held. In Congress Hall, the US Congress passed the 1793 Fugitive Slave Act and heard anti-slavery petitions. In Old City Hall, two mayors publicly demonstrated their support of the anti-slavery movement. The Square and the three buildings are listed on INDE's National Register nomination, while Independence Hall is a World Heritage site."

Everything that contributed to the Resistance Movement of the enslaved who left Texas and sought refuge in Mexico between 1821 and 1865 is the subject of our investigation and dialogue. This process includes selecting a community where slavery was dominant, namely East Texas. We contact local historians and Convention and Visitors Bureaus to make inroads to the general public, educational institutions, businesses, and heritage organizations, i.e., County Historical Commissions. The program then takes several forms: presentations at area schools and colleges, community historic tours, family history workshop, a day-long general session, a cooperative exhibit, and a community recognition dinner."

    "ABSTRACT":"James C. Jordan, one of Iowa's most influential early settlers built this house, probably in phases, between 1850 and 1870. Jordan represented Valley Junction (now West Des Moines) in the Iowa Senate and was influential in introducing legislation to move the state capitol from Iowa City to Des Moines. Under Jordan's leadership the first school in Valley Junction was built. Religious services for all faiths were held in his home. Jordan was apparently a staunch abolitionist and is said to be the \"Chief Conductor\" of the Underground Railroad for Polk County. While it may not be possible to substantiate such a broad claim, his pastor eulogized him by stating \"In the troublous days of slavery this great heart reached out and helped the oppressed, seeking the north star of freedom.\"1 What can be documented reliably about Jordan is that he assisted John Brown on his famous last trip from Kansas before the raid at Harper's Ferry."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Lucius Read House is part of the Byron Museum District. This Greek Revival style home was constructed in 1843 and, following a century of use as a residence, became a restaurant in 1945. A group of local business leaders, aware of the site's historical significance, purchased the building in 1988 and began to restore the home to its original appearance. In 1990, the site became part of the first Museum District in Illinois. Following a decade of site development, including the acquisition of addition property, the Museum District has begun to focus on the history of the site's connections to the Underground Railroad. Currently, group tours of the site include a narrative presentation about the Read family's abolitionist views and activities in the Underground Railroad. An exhibit is currently in development, which will detail the Read family's involvement in the Congregational Church and the Underground Railroad. Open year-round and operating with regular business hours. The Byron Museum District is comprised of the Lucius Read House and Byron Museum of History. The District is dedicated to the historic, cultural and commercial development of the Byron area through commitment to preservation, resource management and display of historical artifacts for public benefit."

The two-story house is a modified Federal-style brick home. In addition, the brick-floored kitchen and spring-fed well are located in the basement. Levi, a well-known Quaker abolitionist, and his family had left North Carolina because of their opposition to slavery. In his Reminiscences, Coffin estimates that he aided and average of 100 freedom seekers a year over the 20 years that he and his wife worked in the Underground Railroad in Fountain City. Levi Coffin's activities in the Underground Railroad caused many to consider him its \"president.\""

    "ABSTRACT":"The Ross Homestead is the only remaining property known to have been part of the Northampton Association of Education and Industry (NAEI). The NAEI was one of a number of Massachusetts's \"utopian\" communities of the 1840's. Largely defined by the abolitionism of its members, several documents confirm the presence of fugitive slaves at the \"Community\", at least two of who became members. The Sojourner Truth and the black abolitionist David Ruggles who reported to have helped 600 slaves to freedom in New York were also members. Frederick Douglass and Samuel J. May visited, as did William Lloyd Garrison whose brother-in-law, George W. Benson, was one of the founders. Eight members are said to have kept safehouses on the Underground Railroad either before or after their time at the NAEI. One of these men, Samuel L. Hill, arranged to purchase Ross Homestead (then the Theodore Burt house) in 1841, merging it with other founders' property to form the 470 acres of the NAEI. Austin Ross arrived in 1845 and was the last director of the Agricultural Department of the NAEI. He remained on the farm in 1846 when the NAEI dissolved. Of all the local agents, Samuel L. Hill and Austin Ross are the most often mentioned in connection with the Underground Railroad. Accordingly, the Ross Homestead well represents the Underground Railroad activity of the NAEI and the subsequent work of Austin and Fidelia Ross."

    "ABSTRACT":"Ferry Hill Plantation, part of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park, is situated along the Potomac River and the canal between Sharpsburg, Maryland and Shepherdstown, West Virginia. Its owners never enslaved large numbers of African Americans -- the maximum was 18 in 1839 at the death of Colonel John Blackford. Enslaved labor, however, was frequently augmented with free white and black workers or hired enslaved people. Those enslaved individuals living at Ferry Hill had frequent contact with free and enslaved kin living elsewhere. In the 1820s and 1830s the river and canal were major corridors of transportation, even for freedom seekers. The family owning the site in those decades records in their journals two captures of runaways who were taken to the Hagerstown Jail. For one set of 5 runaways, the captor received a bounty of $200."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Underground Railroad monument celebrates this important national movement by visually depicting the African American and white \"conductors\" who helped the fugitive slaves escape bondage and the men, women and children who risked their lives to reach freedom. The monumental bronze sculpture shows Harriet Tubman leading a tired band of runaways from the cover of a dark forest. Tubman, known as the \"Black Moses,\" is one of the Underground Railroad's most enduring figures. On the other side of the sculpture Erastus Hussey and his wife, Sarah, help the fugitives into a safe hiding place. The Husseys were Battle Creek Quaker abolitionists who risked financial ruin and imprisonment while harboring escaping slaves. The Husseys never met Harriet Tubman. But their service and sacrifice typifies the brave men and women who traveled on, and operated, the Underground Railroad. The Underground Railroad monument is intended to remind us of these past achievements and of the ongoing struggle to preserve human rights for all."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Harriet Tubman Home in Auburn, New York, adopted home of Harriet Tubman (1812-1913), was for many years an asylum for the needy, the oppressed and unfortunate, irrespective of nationality. Her formal residency at this site begins around 1858. Harriet Tubman led her parents out of slavery to a growing black community in St. Catherine, Ontario. The severe Canadian winters were too much for her aged parents to bear and the Auburn site was also safe from slave- kidnappers. Tubman resided here with her parents, other relatives, and many sojourners on the freedom trail. Harriet Tubman acquired the initial 7+ acres for $1200.00 from William Seward, a fellow abolitionist. In 1895, Tubman acquired an adjacent property to the north for the purpose of establishing a home for the aged. This property was deeded to the A.M.E. Zion Church in 1903. Her residence and the original 7+ acres were willed to her surviving descendants in 1913. A year later, this property was sold to a local family. In 1990, the A.M.E. Zion Church acquired the property. Harriet Tubman spent over fifty years in Auburn, surviving many of her fellow abolitionists. Unlike many engaged in the abolition cause, Tubman remained committed to social activism and was concerned with the welfare of fellow former enslaved persons. Her residence often served as a way station for escaping slaves in route to Canada."

The next morning the Mexico vigilance committee moved the fugitive away from the center of the village to Asa Beebe's barn in Toad Hollow. After two weeks in hiding there the committee brought him twelve miles into the City of Oswego where he embarked for Canada. Jerry Henry's widely publicized escape from a Syracuse jail and his successful flight through Upstate New York directly challenged the federal government's ability to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. One hundred and fifty years later, the Orson Ames House, one of several locations where Henry received shelter, is the only property which remains to mark his celebrated race to freedom."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Bloomingburg Presbyterian Church was the center of both anti-slavery and Underground Railroad activity in the village of Bloomingburg, Fayette County, Ohio. The physical structure served as a meeting place of stalwart abolitionists, while the congregation of worshipers included a number of Underground Railroad operatives, several of whom were prominent in the church's leadership. This included the church's pastor, Rev. William Dickey, and church trustees and elders: William Ustick, James Stewart, and Dr. Gillespie. Letters to Wilbur Siebert from several contemporary local men confirm these men's association with the Underground Railroad. Sometime prior to 1856, the Bloomingburg Presbyterian Church was acted by an anti-slavery mob for the perceived involvement of the congregation. Today the congregation still worships in the original building and is proud of the church's strong heritage respecting social justice."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Clemens Farmstead is one of the few remaining structures of Longtown AKA the Greenville Negro Settlement. Mr. Clemens (1781-1870 founded the settlement, officially bought the land there in 1818 and lived in the settlement until his death. It is estimated that the house was built between 1822 and 1857. According to William Siebert in his manuscript The Underground Railroad, Longtown was a stop in the Underground Railroad. In Siebert's interview with Col. David Putnam of Palestine August 13, 1898 Mr. Putnam states \"At the Greenville Negro settlement was another station. The Clemens and the Alexander's were the leaders in the movement there. These were Negro families.\" The Clemens are listed as Darke County operators in Appendix E (Directory of the Names of Underground Railroad Operators) in Wilbert H. Sierbert's The Underground Railroad from Slavery to Freedom. Also, in the manuscript is a letter from Jno. Reily Knox dated on August 7, 1884 to Professor Siebert Mr. Knox that states \"The hunters visited Greenville, and after consultation with a certain law firm, they went in the night to the colored settlement and searched several cabins.\" In a 1981 letter from Mrs. Kenton Dye of Winchester Indiana to Mrs. Toni Seller the Director of the Garest Museum, Mrs. Kenton writes that she talked to Maze Clemens a descendant of James Clemens. He stated to her that \"His grandfather escorted runaway slaves from Newport (now Fountain City, Indiana) to Longtown where they were hidden all day before being transported to Paulding, Ohio, where it was assumed they were safe.\""

The location of the home in Perry Township placed it near the town of Greenfield, which was heavily involved in the Underground Railroad. Within a very tight radius of the house lived four documented Underground Railroad operatives: Alexander Beatty, William Templeton, Ebenezer McElroy, and William Smith, all interrelated by marriage and all Presbyterians. West's story is being researched through the efforts of the Research History Class of Washington Senior High School, Washington Court House, Ohio, which is researching census records, tax records, deeds, and other documents, in an attempt to corroborate the oral traditions passed down to West family descendants, as well as the current property owners. It is appropriate to mark the West property in commemoration of the racial cooperation necessary for the success of the Underground Railroad."

One commitment has been to identify archaeological sites related to the Underground Railroad by developing and implementing an innovative research strategy. Using William Still's book Underground Railroad and runaway ads, local records have been mined to tie surviving structures and archeological sites to sites of enslavement of those seeking freedom. The Museum has created a compilation of freedom seekers, sites of enslavement, and free African American areas. It has also excavated several sites related to African Americans and has an extensive African American collection (free and enslaved). The Museum collects information on the history of Alexandria, educates the public, and sponsors ongoing research related to the Underground Railroad."

Slough, Alexandria's Military Governor, seized a parcel on South Washington Street and established a cemetery for former slaves. The 1999-2000 test excavations by the cultural resources management firm, URS Geiner Woodward Clyde, unearthed evidence of nearly 60 graves. An earlier ground penetrating radar survey by another firm indicated the presence of many burials beneath a gas station parking lot. Many of those buried were \"Contrabands\", enslaved people fleeing to Union-held Alexandria to seek freedom and protection. A memorial is in progress."

    "ABSTRACT":"Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial, is a unit of the National Park Service and consists of a Greek-Revival mansion, two slave quarters, a museum, and the house grounds. George Washington Parke Custis and his bondsmen began construction of the home in 1802 and completed it sixteen years later. The Arlington estate was an 1,100-acre plantation on which enslaved workers grew corn, wheat, garden produce, and raised livestock. Custis and some of his enslaved people contributed money to the controversial American Colonization Society, which established colonies in Africa for emancipated slaves. Some of Custis' enslaved individuals were not content to wait for freedom. During Custis' lifetime, and later when his son-in-law, Robert E. Lee, administered the property, a number ran away from the plantation. Custis mentioned runaways in an 1831 letter. In 1836, Jane Steiner was charged in a Washington DC court with aiding a runaway from Arlington. Three more slaves fled Arlington in 1859 and their flight received much attention in the press. In 1862, all of the remaining slaves received their freedom as specified in Custis' will. During the Civil War, many formerly enslaved people settled at Freedmen's Village located on the Arlington estate."

Court records, papers of the governors, and documents of state agencies are invaluable sources of information about fugitive slaves, the people who helped them, and the state's efforts to close the Underground Railroad in Virginia. There are also extensive documentary collections on slave revolts, especially Gabriel Conspiracy of 1800 and Nat Turner's Rebellion in 1831, and on John Brown's raid in 1856. As a public research facility with educational and outreach materials at the Library's Web site, the Library of Virginia will be an important regional facility for Underground Railroad research."

    "ABSTRACT":"Harpers Ferry NHP has multiple verifiable associations with the Underground Railroad. Most nationally significant are the Armory Ground and Engine House where abolitionist John Brown's 1859 Raid unfolded. Brown attempted and failed to seize weapons from the national armory in order to garner local and regional support to start a war on slavery and free thousands of slaves throughout the south. During the antebellum period, the area was still part of Virginia. Several escapes from slavery are documented through local newspaper reports and one is included in William Still's book, The Underground Railroad. Many of these stories took place at the \"Point\" area of the town where the Potomac and Shenandoah Rivers converge. When the town was occupied by northern forces during the Civil War, escapees who passed into Union lines seeking protection, were designated \"prize of war\", \"contraband\", detained in a contraband camp at the former Armory enclosure and placed on work details for the US Quartermaster. United States military records' regimental morning reports detail military and civilian activities, and Freedmen's Bureau's operations reports in West Virginia document African American lives on the road to freedom. These and many other escaped African Americans' stories are integrated in the park's John Brown Museum, Black Voices Exhibit, publications, educational programs, and public history tours."

    "ABSTRACT":"Because Delaware was a slave state that bordered the free state of Pennsylvania, Delaware played an important role in the Underground Railroad. In \"The Long Road to Freedom\", students hear stories of the brave men and women, both enslaved and free, who made this region one of the most successful Underground Railroad routes to freedom. Students learn about Thomas Garrett, Harriet Tubman and William Still. This interactive educational program covers the following themes: what is slavery, was Delaware a slave state or free state, who helped slaves escape, and what was the Underground Railroad. These themes are introduced through the use of illustrated storytelling, group discussion, hands-on activities involving authentic and reproduction artifacts, tours in a historically important building, and a take-home craft."

From here and from his business within the same block, Garrett helped some 2,700 fugitives gain their freedom. From this site, he operated a network of free African Americans, Quakers, and others who helped conduct slaves to freedom. He provided a safe haven for conductors, such as Harriet Tubman and provided links to important sites to the north, including the one operated by William Still in Philadelphia. Operating in a slave state, Garrett was fearless in his determination to seek freedom for others and once was stripped of all his property because of his activities on behalf of slaves."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Captain William Mitchell Farmhouse is a well-preserved vernacular structure that began its existence as a log cabin in the late spring of 1856. Captain Mitchell built it with the help of the newly arrived members of the Connecticut-Kansas Colony, later called the Beecher Bible and Rifle Colony. Inspired by Horace Greeley, Eli Thayer and other anti-slavery proponents this emigrant colony had been organized in New Haven, CT by Charles Lines for the purpose of insuring Kansas' entry into the Union as a non-slave or free state. Not long after the colonists had erected their own shelters they began sheltering and assisting freedom seekers escaping from Missouri, Arkansas and Texas. Captain Mitchell was one of the most active URR participants in the settlement, acting as both stationmaster and conductor. His father William Mitchell Sr. and his sister Agnes joined him from Connecticut, and it was Agnes who no doubt cooked for their guests. The structure has been continuously occupied since 1856. Over the years additions have been made and the log cabin is now the living room of the present house."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Dr. John Doy homesite, today about three miles northwest of downtown Lawrence, Kansas was part of the original 160 acre tract where abolitionist, John Doy settled in October 1854 as part of the New England Emigrant Aid Company. Doy was called the \"General Conductor\" of the UGRR in the Lawrence area. On this property he lived in a log structure with family from 1854-1860. In 1999 the remains of a foundation, a limestone well and a cistern were discovered in a wooded part of the original tract by a neighborhood boy. Although no documentation has been found about UGRR activity on the property, there is ample documentation \"including his own book published in 1860€ of Doy's UGRR activity. He was captured in January 1859 while taking 13 Blacks north on the UGRR. His daring rescue from the St. Joseph, Missouri jail by \"The Immortal Ten\" was reported nationally. In 2001, a pedestrian archeological survey of the Doy property was done. Although much of the former quarter-section of the Doy property has been developed, the ruins, some of the woods and a small creek still remain. The Underground Railroad Association of Douglas County hopes to have further archeological evaluation of the property."

Corroborating written reminiscences preserved in the Kansas State Historic Society and the Wabaunsee County Historical Society and local oral history provide evidence of the Homestead's role in the Underground Railroad in the mid-nineteenth century. The Harvey family were members of the Society of Friends and life-long anti-slavery proponents. Members of their extended family had been active in the URR in Ohio. Ann and Henry also served as Quaker missionaries to the Shawnee Tribe, helping them get established in Kansas. Their son George Madden Harvey filed the first claim in Richardson County, Kansas Territory on the adjoining property. Evidence suggests he lived with his parents. The Harvey home was a station on the URR, and sons George and Samuel are thought to have been conductors. There is also evidence that their grandson Al was involved. The Harvey log cabin existed until ca. 1900 when the present vernacular frame house was constructed. The farmstead continues to operate as a working farm in what remains essentially a nineteenth century landscape."

    "ABSTRACT":"Sotterley Plantation, St. Mary's County, Maryland, encompasses almost 300 years of Southern Maryland history. Sotterley, as we know it today, was part of an original 1650 land grant of 4000 acres. In 1717, James Bowles constructed the original Mansion House. During the 18th century it was a thriving tobacco plantation, owned by the Plater family, and in the 19th century, under the Briscoe family, Sotterley continued as a plantation and busy steamboat landing. Records indicate a community of enslaved African Americans under James Bowles through the Plater era of the 18th century. In the 19th century the estate contained one of the largest communities of enslaved African Americans in southern Maryland. Today the plantation is maintained as an example of a tidewater plantation on the banks of the Patuxent River. Remarkably, thanks to descendant Agnes Kane Callum, there is a great deal of documented information available on her enslaved family members, as well as on the plantation's owners. In the 18th century George Plater III, Maryland's 6th Governor, advertised as runaways: Towerhill (Maryland Gazette, Feb 16, 1786) and Clem (Maryland Gazette Dec. 2, 1784). In the 19th century, George Briscoe escaped servitude at Sotterley to join the US Colored Troops."

    "ABSTRACT":"The element being nominated for inclusion in the Network to Freedom is entitled the Underground Railroad Living Experience. Its theme is the preservation of the universal right of freedom through the unified efforts of a caring, courageous community. It is an experiential tour that is a part of the Living Museum of the Historic First Congregational Church of Detroit, which prior to moving to its present location in 1891, was located on Fort and Wayne streets in downtown Detroit, and church records describe as one to the stations of the UGRR. As a Program Partner of the Detroit 300th Anniversary Celebration in the year 2001, the Church develop a tour in 6000 square feet of its lower level which simulates an Underground Railroad escape. The one hour \"escape\" tours, which take place in the year 1856, begin with the participant/slaves receiving a slave \"shackle\" and them being led by a Conductor on a 1000 mile escape from a sugar cane plantation in Louisiana through alligator-infested swamps and deep dense forests, over the Ohio River, through Indiana, Michigan, and finally over the Detroit River to freedom in Canada. Along the way, they encounter cast members portraying other runaway slaves, slave catchers, Quaker safe house keepers, a Congregational Minister, and a host of others. \"Escaping slave\" participants describe the experience as both enlightening and heart-wrenching."

    "ABSTRACT":"St. Louis' Old Courthouse was built between 1839 and 1862. It was a public forum as well as a courthouse. Slaves were auctioned from its steps in estate settlements, while one man's suit for freedom helped plunge the country into Civil War. In the lower west courtroom one of the most important cases ever tried in the United States began. In 1847 and again in 1850, a slave named Dred Scott and his wife Harriet sued for, and were granted, their freedom. Appeals to higher courts by their owner took their freedom away, and led to the momentous Supreme Court decision of 1857, which upheld the ruling that they should remain slaves, and declared the Missouri Compromise of 1820 unconstitutional. The Dred Scott Decision hastened the start of the Civil War. It is also the most famous of thousands of civil suits launched by slaves throughout the United States in the antebellum period to try to gain their freedom through the action of the courts. As such it represents another avenue toward freedom for slaves other than manumission or flight. The Old Courthouse stands only two blocks from the Gateway Arch and contains restored courtrooms, museum exhibits on the Dred Scott Decision, historical dioramas, and the headquarters of Jefferson National Expansion Memorial. Ranger-led tours are available at scheduled times, as are public programs on civil rights and slavery. Mock trials highlight the struggles of Dred and Harriet Scott for their freedom as well as lesser-known cases like that of Lucy Delaney, a 12 year old girl who sued for her freedom three years before the Scotts, or Caroline Williams, who challenged St. Louis' segregation policies on public transportation in 1869."

After he secured his freedom, he became the main \"agent\" of the Underground Railroad in Elmira. Mr. Jones sheltered runaway slaves at his home on Church Street while he made arrangements for their safe passage to Canada. Mr. Jones' home was located next to the Elmira First Baptist Church where he was employed as the church sexton. In 1890, a new church was built, and the church purchased Mr. Jones' home. The home was torn down to allow room for expansion. With the help of some of the most prominent citizens of Elmira, John W. Jones helped over 800 individuals in their flight to freedom. Some of the prominent individuals who assisted Mr. Jones were, Jervis Langdon, (Mark Twain's father-in-law), Simeon Benjamin, (founder and first president of the board of Elmira College), Reverend Thomas K. Beecher, (brother of Harriet Beecher Stowe), and Ariel S. Thurston, a prominent judge."

Family accounts recall the night time appearance of runaways who were secreted in the house and then \"spirited away\" before morning. The house is located in the historic Germantown section of Philadelphia, an anti-slavery stronghold where in 1688 colonial America's first formal anti-slavery protest was held. The Johnson property, stretching from Wissahickon Creek and along what was then known as Abington Lane, was strategically located between the Schyukill River to the south and Underground Railroad stations in Montgomery County to the north. Johnson family members were founders, leaders and members of no less than forty organizations dedicated to abolition and the welfare of freed blacks, including the Pennsylvania Abolition Society, the Philadelphia Free Produce Association, the Vigilance Committee of Philadelphia, the Junior Anti-Slavery Society of Philadelphia and the Pennsylvania Yearly Meeting of Progressive Friends. These organizations put them in regular contact with Underground activists such as Lucretia Mott and Robert Purvis which further confirms their roles as leaders of the anti-slavery movement."

Over 70 freedom seekers were on board. Unfortunately, the attempt failed, and many of the bondspeople involved were bought by slave traders for sale further south. Among these unfortunates were the Edmonson sisters who were purchased by the slave trading firm, Bruin , Hill. After a period in the Bruin, Hill slave pen at 1707 Duke Street, Alexandria, Virginia, the sisters were sent to New Orleans. An outbreak of yellow fever meant that Joseph Bruin brought them back to Alexandria, where they worked for the Bruin family until the sisters' parents were able to raise money in New York City to redeem them. The sisters then attended Oberlin College. After sister Mary died, Emily the surviving sister returned to D. C. to teach with Myrtilla Miner."

    "ABSTRACT":"Gadsby's Tavern Museum, located on the southwest corner of Cameron and Royal Streets, is a cultural icon for the early Federal period celebrated in Alexandria, Virginia. The museum consists of two tavern buildings, the ca. 1785 tavern and the 1792 City Tavern and Hotel. While the museum includes several generations of tavern-keepers in its interpretation, it is tavern-keeper John Gadsby for whom the complex named. John Gadsby ran the City Tavern and Hotel from 1796 to 1808. One of the largest taverns in Alexandria at the time, it catered to the upper classes and was visited by many of the early American Presidents, including George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. Most tavern-keepers in Virginia relied on a staff of enslaved African Americans to accomplish the tavern's work. Gadsby's 1802 inventory indicates that he owned 11 enslaved workers making up $3,555 of his $22,441 estate."

Dedicated to freedom, equality, and the advancement of her people, Mary Ann Shadd Cary (1823-1893) is nationally significant for the 12 years she spent in Canada where she edited the best newspaper for freedom seekers, The Provincial Freeman, and where she worked with Samuel Ringgold Ward and other well-known black activists favoring emigration to Canada as a solution for US African Americans. While editor of the Provincial Freeman, Mary Ann Shadd Cary championed Canada West as a permanent refuge for freedom seekers and free blacks. She publicly solicited aid for runaway bondspeople, at risk to herself."

    "ABSTRACT":"Built in 1815 in the Quaker Hill neighborhood of Wilmington as the center for worship in the city for members of the Religious Society of Friends, the Wilmington Friends Meeting House is the building that best represents the well documented contributions of the members of the Religious Society of Friends to the Underground Railroad. In the early decades of the 19th century, abolitionist members used the law to assist freedom seekers through the acting committee of the Delaware Abolition Society. Thomas Garrett, the well known station master who assisted over 2700 freedom seekers on their journey, lived nearby, worshiped here, and is buried in the cemetery. Isaac Flint, a member of this congregation, purchased the freedom of a conductor on the Underground Railroad and free African American, Samuel D. Burris, when he was sentenced to servitude for assisting a freedom seeker in Kent County. We are still learning the history of the participants in the Underground Railroad in Wilmington but it is clear that this building provided opportunity and forum for those interested members to work to assist freedom seekers on their journey through Delaware to freedom."

The museum's mission is to inspire children to have respect for their ancestors, a love of learning and a passion for service. It also aims to strengthen black American families and empower them to maintain historical bonds of kinship, and to assist in the promulgation of the culture for the benefit of the general population. One such project related to these endeavors has been the creation of an Underground Railroad research center. This center includes books, articles, and other information directly associated with the Underground Railroad, history of various fights for freedom, the experiences of slavery in the Americas, free black communities in Spanish Florida, and biographies of prominent abolitionists. The Underground Railroad also is featured prominently in the permanent exhibits."

    "ABSTRACT":"In response to the 1998 challenge by the National Park Service for State Historic Preservation offices to locate their Underground Railroad resources, the Indian Division of Historic Preservation and Archaeology (DHPA) created its Underground Railroad Initiative in 1998. In 1999, the DHPA formed a committee of volunteers known as the Indian Freedom Trails (IFT), with the purpose of researching the UGRR; the IFT has been accepted into the Network to Freedom as an Educational and Research Program. This group has group has grown such that it is working towards not-for-profit status, but remains a strong partner DHPA. The DHPA UGRR Initiative takes several forms to assure the research, preservation, and education of Indiana's UGRR heritage. The DHPA accomplishes these goals through publications, conferences, presentations, volunteer recruitment, preservation of structures, and research training. DHPS has seen several successes including publications of researchers' original work, well-attended conferences, extensive media exposure, volunteer recruitment and training, preservation of known UGRR sites, and increased public outreach."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Catoctin Iron Furnace represents a case of freedom seekers connected to industrial slavery in Maryland. The Johnson brothers built the Furnace and Manor House in the late 1770's and began making iron in 1776. At that time, the Johnson brothers -- James, Thomas, Roger, and Baker, were the largest owners of enslaved persons in Frederick County, MD, and employed both additional enslaved labor and freemen as necessary to fill production orders. There is evidence of enslaved labor until at least 1848, and several of these workers were buried in a graveyard that was relocated due to construction of US Rt. 15 in the early 1970s. Period newspaper advertisements provide evidence of at least one freedom seeker in 1780, and of a kidnapping of a freeman's son by a Caucasian man in the 1800's. After the Johnsons retired from the iron industry, the Catoctin Iron Furnace went through several owners and technological changes and continued to operate until 1903. Today, the only remains of the facility are a large inoperable charcoal-fired stone furnace called \"Isabella,\" a recreated casting shed, a large retaining wall, and the ruins of the Furnace Master's manor house."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Mayhew Cabin had a real role in Nebraska's Underground Railroad as Freedom Seekers moved quickly through Nebraska City, across the Missouri River, into the free-state of Iowa, and ultimately to real freedom in Canada. Freedom Seekers stopped at the cabin several times. E.F. Mayhew, son of Allen and Barbara, recalled one such incident in a 1925 letter to N.C. Abbott, superintendent of Nebraska School for the Blind. Mayhew states, \"John Henri Kagi [sic] brought 14 negroes (to the Mayhew Cabin) for breakfast one morning. It was at this time that the officers and some men from Missouri came to the house after him (John Kagy) although my father told them he was upstairs, they were afraid to go after him knowing he was armed.\" John was the brother-in-law of Mayhew, John Brown's adjutant-general, and died at 24-years of age at Harper's Ferry. The original Mayhew cabin is located at 2012 4th Corso in Nebraska City, Nebraska. Allen B. and wife, Barbara (Kagy) Mayhew constructed their cabin home with square hand-hewn logs from native cottonwood trees. The cuts from the smoothing ax are still plainly visible on the logs today. The 14 x 16 feet cabin is furnished to represent the late 1850s."

    "ABSTRACT":"Oatlands Plantation was begun in 1804 by George Carter, great-grandson of Virgina's renowned planter, Robert \"King\" Carter. With the addition of many dependency buildings, the plantation soon became a 3400-acre estate. The complex is valuable as a social document of Piedmont Virginia country life in the early 19th century. The Plantation is associated with the UGRR because of runaway ads and letters by George Carter documenting escapes from slavery. The story of \"Billy\" (William Jordon Augustus) begins with 2 newspaper ads (1809) and continues in a series of letters between Carter, his nephew Tom and a Doctor. Billy apparently escaped to PA where he lived for at least 8 years before being apprehended and lodged in a jail in Baltimore. Through a ruse, he was able to once again escape, probably to Pennsylvania."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Asbury United Methodist Church continues to be a prominent African American church in Washington, DC. It is significant to resistance to slavery through flight, because members were involved in the Pearl Affair, one of the largest attempted escapes in the United States before the Civil War. At least two enslaved members of the church, Emily and Mary Edmonson, were fleeing to freedom on the ship The Pearl when it was apprehended and returned to DC. These enslaved teenagers were sold to slave trader Joseph Bruin of Alexandria, VA, as a result of their attempted flight. Through their father's appeal to abolitionists in New York, money was raised to redeem them from enslavement. One letter of introduction to influential men in New York City was written by the white pastor of Asbury United Methodist Church, Rev. Matthew Turner, and is reproduced in the introduction to James W. C. Pennington's book, The Fugitive Slave (1849). Edmonson family membership in Asbury United Methodist Church was reported in an article in the Anti-Slavery Bugle, published by the western branch of the Anti-Slavery Association in Salem, OH. The incident had an influence on Congressmen and authors like Harriet Beecher Stowe alike."

    "ABSTRACT":"Woodlawn Cemetery in Washington, D.C., is the final resting place of Blanche K. Bruce, an escaped bondsman who served a term as Senator from the state of Mississippi in the 1870s. Blanche K. Bruce (1841-98) was a prominent black leader during the Reconstruction period. After serving as US Senator, he became Registrar of the U.S. Treasury and Recorder of Deeds for the District of Columbia, as well as sitting on the city's Board of Education and the Board of Howard University. He was a close friend of Frederick Douglass and a member of Washington, D.C.'s black elite. He was born enslaved in Virginia; his owner moved him several times between that state and Mississippi and Missouri. He escaped from Missouri to freedom in 1862, and fled first to Lawrence, Kansas. After the war he taught school in Kansas and Missouri. The details of his childhood are well documented in his brother's book The New Man. Bruce's escape is documented in his own words as printed in the \"Washington Letter\" (The Kansas City Times 1886)."

Eleutherian College was formed in the 1848-49 school year for the purpose of educating all students that came to them regardless of race or gender. The founders operated a station on the Underground Railroad, which was known as the \"New England Settlement\" by George De Baptiste, who was a well known Underground Railroad conductor living in Madison, Indiana and later Detroit, Michigan. The founders formed the \"Neil's Creek Anti-Slavery Society\" which operated from 1839 to 1845. According to their constitution, their objective in Article 2 was, \"the entire abolition of slavery in the United States\", and their objective in Article 3 was, \"the Society shall aim to elevate the character and condition of the people of color, by encouraging their intellectual, moral and religious improvement\". The founders started a church named the \"Anti-Slavery Baptist Church\" that worshipped in the chapel of the Eleutherian College. Historic Eleutherian College, Inc.'s mission is to preserve this National Historic Landmark and Civil War site in order to teach the history to future generations."

    "ABSTRACT":"Lyman Hoyt House, an active station on the Underground Railroad was operated by the owner, Lyman Hoyt. Lyman and wife Asenath Whipple Hoyt moved from Vermont to Lancaster, Indiana, in 1830 to join James Nelson and his wife Lucy Whipple Nelson that came to Lancaster, Indiana in 1820 from Vermont. Dr. Samuel Tibbets and wife Susanna Coombs Tibbets moved to Lancaster, Indiana in 1830 from Clermont County Ohio, had previously lived in Vermont. These three families brought children with these moves and marriages occurred to link these families. John H. Tibbets married Sarah Ann Nelson Tibbets making John a nephew of Lyman Hoyt. This provided the trust for this group to work the Underground Railroad routes without getting caught. This group of families had similar backgrounds and beliefs of \"freedom\" being available for all races. Lyman was one of the main conductors in Lancaster, Indiana from 1830 to 1856. The Hoyts had the first black student to enter Eleutherian College living in their home. Lyman hid runaway freedom seekers in his barn loft and a cave near his home and gave his clothing, food and transportation in his wagons to the next station."

    "ABSTRACT":"Great Dismal Swamp, once estimated at a million acres, is located in southeastern VA and northeastern NC. Since the 17th century, historians, surveyors, and newspaper ads have identified the swamp and canal (within) as a refuge and route to freedom for thousands of runaway enslaved African Americans. For some, the swamp offered a means to purchase their freedom, through work on the canal and in cedar and cypress shingle and timber production. Others found refuge deep within the swamp, living off the land and what they could steal. These \"outliers\" established maroon communities on the higher points of the swamp. Many lived there, raised families, and died there. For others the swamp was a \"stopping point\" to get to Norfolk or Portsmouth, VA, or to the Albemarle Sound and Elizabeth City, NC, where they could secure passage on a ship traveling north. Despite the method or living conditions, the swamp provided the means of freedom which so many sought. During the Civil War, Union regiments of the USCT under Brig. Gen. Augustus Wild marched down the canal bank from Deep Creek in northeast NC to liberate and recruit enslaved African Americans in NC."

    "ABSTRACT":"Jervis Langdon is better known as Mark Twain's father-in-law than he is for being an abolitionist and an active participant in the Underground Railroad. From 1847 until 1860, a most crucial time of the Underground Railroad period, Jervis Langdon and his family lived in a house on East Union. Jervis Langdon was a self-made millionaire and one of the central figures in the Underground Railroad in Chemung County. He not only provided funding, he also provided lodging and was active in anti-slavery activities in the county. This site is significant because it is the only existing Langdon home. The last home he lived in from 1860 until his death in 1870 is very well known. It was a grand mansion on Main Street in Elmira, New York and it took up a whole city block, from Church Street to First Street. In this home, Olivia Langdon married Samuel Clemens, (Mark Twain). Unfortunately, this mansion was torn down in 1939 and later replaced by a shopping plaza named Langdon Plaza."

    "ABSTRACT":"Chester County Historical Society (CCHS), founded in 1893, is a not-for-profit educational institution whose mission is to promote an understanding of the history of Chester County and southeastern Pennsylvania by collecting, preserving, exhibiting and interpreting that history and its relationship to the region, and nation beyond, to audiences of all ages and interests. With diverse audiences and Chester County's unique heritage at its core, CCHS is an educational leader in the history community of southeastern Pennsylvania. Located in a largely suburban area southwest of Philadelphia in a region rich with museums, CCHS has established a clear identity as the only institution offering a comprehensive history of the southeastern Pennsylvania region dating to its beginnings in 1682. Because of the important role Chester County played in the American Revolution and the abolition of slavery, scholars and out-of-state visitors as well as those from the neighboring counties often use our collections and attend our programs and exhibitions. CCHS develops and serves its audiences through the following efforts: a fully-accessible, barrier-free facility, six galleries for permanent and temporary exhibits, school programs delivered through outreach as well as on-site efforts, two lecture series each year, and collaboration with organizations serving non-traditional museum audiences, civic organizations, schools and colleges. Together with Chester County government, CCHS administers the Chester County Archives. This cooperative relationship adds three-hundred years of public records to the Society's care, one of the finest and most complete collections of historic county records in the nation."

    "ABSTRACT":"The First National Bank Museum is one of the few banks in the United States still preserved within its original setting, and among its original records are books of accounts from the antebellum period providing a rare view of the degree of wealth of two prominent African American businessmen who also acted as Underground Railroad conductors. During the Bank's years of operation in the early and middle nineteenth century, Stephen Smith and William Whipper used their own financial resources and the actual railroad cars in which they shipped lumber to Philadelphia to secretly forwarded freedom seekers onto the next station in their hazardous journey. Whipper is recorded in William Still's seminal book on the Underground Railroad to have given at least $1000 a year to freedom seekers in the years leading up to the Civil War. They were the wealthiest members of an African American community in the place where most historians recount, albeit anecdotally, that the Underground Railroad received its name."

    "ABSTRACT":"Erie County Historical Society is committed to maintaining a library and archives to discover, select, arrange, preserve and make information of the history of Erie County and its people available to the public. With a strong collection of original manuscripts, business and community archives, it is a central repository for manuscripts and archival material recently donated by Mercyhurst College, and Erie Historical Museum Archives recently acquired through merger, totaling over 800+ separate collections. It also serves as a repository for selected city and county government records of permanent value on loan. The professional staff provides access, reference service and research access to this significant collection of material. The repository contains special collections, legal documents, newspapers (microfilm), church records, quarter sessions records, and other source material which are essential research resources when studying anti-slavery and the Underground Railroad. John Brown, who lived in near-by Crawford County is mentioned in one primary source. The papers of the author of From Dixie to Canada, include stories collected from original sources and published in Lakeshore Magazine. With a significant collection of original documents relating to anti-slavery and the Underground Railroad, ECHS's Library Archives can become a key regional facility in the Network to Freedom."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Pennsylvania State Archives is officially known as the Division of Archives and Manuscripts of the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission .Its primary function is to acquire, preserve, and make available for study the permanently valuable records of the Commonwealth, with particular attention to records of state, county, and municipal governments. The Archives also acquires and preserves private papers relevant to Pennsylvania history. Its holdings consist of over fifty-seven thousand cubic feet of historical records and nearly twenty-four thousand reels of microfilm. Many of these are critical to an understanding of the Underground Railroad in Pennsylvania and why slaves would want to reach this \"free\" state. The Archives also maintains a website at www.phmc.state.pa.us with detailed descriptions of its holdings.  The website features \"Doc Heritage\" a timeline of Pennsylvania history through historical documents, \"PA History: People, Places, Things and Events\" which includes items relating to slavery, free blacks, and the Underground Railroad; ARIAS, the Archives Records Information Access System, currently offering original records of Pennsylvania's Civil War soldiers, including the United States Colored Troops (USCT) and a link to ExplorePAHistory.com a WITF-PBS affiliate/PHMC site which uses State Historical Markers to present a variety of historical, travel, and student lesson plans."

    "ABSTRACT":"William C. Goodridge (1805-1876) was not only the most prominent African-American stationmaster in Antebellum York City but was also, by virtue of his various enterprises (barbering, retail/wholesale, transportation, photography, etc.), an influential member of Antebellum Pennsylvania's nascent African-American middle class. In recognition of his importance, the Penna. Historical and Museum Commission placed an historical marker in front of his residence at 123 E. Philadelphia Street in York. A measure of Goodridge's importance is the railroad cars which he owned and used to transport goods and fugitives from York to Philadelphia. Osborne Perry Anderson's account of his escape from the debacle at Harper's Ferry in 1859 underscores how Goodridge not only hid him but also helped him to escape capture. Also, Goodridge reportedly transported William Parker and his compatriots after their resistance of the slave master in Christiana in 1851. Goodridge's anti-slavery efforts began in the late 1840's after the well-known Prigg Case which established Pennsylvania as free soil for the fugitive. Local historians have linked Goodridge with William Whipper and Stephen Smith, important African-American businessmen and U.G.R.R. stationmasters in Columbia and Philadelphia. The three were apparently business partners."

    "ABSTRACT":"William Noble-Samuel Denney House Inn A.K.A. \"Christiana Machine Co.\" played a central role in a series of events, beginning on September 11, 1851, that have been called, collectively, a major spark in the kindling of the Civil War ten years later. The Christiana Riot, as it was called, forever placed the Lancaster County community on the historical map and it represented a significant point in the notable career of U.S. Congressman, Thaddeus Stevens, an ardent Abolitionist and Underground Railroad activist. The Whig Congressman from Lancaster County served as co-counsel for the defense of the 38 citizens charged with treason against the United States for their participation in what is now referred to as The Resistance at Christiana. It was at the Noble-Denney House and Inn that the postmortem examination of the body of slain slave owner Edward Gorsuch was held, following his death in a violent fight at the William Parker farm, located a few miles south and east of the town of Christiana. Noble-Denney House and Inn was the site of the first phase of the official inquest into this pivotal event. The thirty-eight accused with treason were held at Noble-Denney House and Inn until they could be transported to Moymensing Prison in Philadelphia for trial. The eventual acquittal of the Christiana townsmen on federal treason charges effectively challenged the legal and political strength of the 1850 Fugitive Slave Law, and began its eventual demise. Commemorative events marking the 60th anniversary of the Resistance was held on the steps of the hotel in 1911. The extant monument on site was dedicated to those involved in the Resistance. The site of the actual confrontation was cleared on the Parker Farm House in 1899."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Afro-American Historical Association (AAHA) operates a museum, genealogical research center, library, document and photographic archive, and educational facility that interprets regional and national African American history. Our highly agricultural region of rural VA was heavily dependent on enslaved labor prior to the Civil War and much of the African American population living here now are descended from the enslaved and freed people of that era. A large part of the facility's mission is to document, preserve, research, and interpret the history of slavery and resistance in the region. Through original documents, recorded oral history, maps, and artifacts, the facility shares a hidden history with visitors from all over the US. We are especially pleased to offer an exhibit titled, \"Footprints to Change,\" which illustrates the Underground Railroad in Fauquier County. Staff are currently researching runaways in the county."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Loudoun County Courthouse site is significant to the history of the UGRR in VA. On this site Leesburg attorney John Janney took part in at least 2 significant trials. In 1840 Janney obtained the least punishment possible for free-born carriage-driver Leonard Grimes for stealing slave Patty and her six children on behalf of Patty's free husband. Grimes served two years in a Richmond jail; Patty and her family reportedly reached safety in Canada. In the second trial, Janney successfully argued the 1846 acquittal of freed slave Nelson Talbott Gant for stealing his enslaved wife Maria with the help of UGRR agents in PA and OH. Gant was then able to purchase Maria's freedom and the couple moved to OH. Gant and Grimes, along with many others of their race, had been registered as free at the courthouse."

    "ABSTRACT":"Sully Historic Site is part of the Fairfax County Park Authority. It consists of a Georgian House with Federal Period overtones; outbuildings consisting of original kitchen and laundry, smokehouse, dairy, a representative slave quarter; and gardens and grounds. Richard Bland Lee, an uncle of Robert E. Lee, lived at Sully from 1794-1811 with his wife Elizabeth Collins Lee, their children and wards, and up to 40 enslaved African Americans. Mr. Lee inherited 1500 acres of land and 29 bondsmen upon the death of his father, Henry Lee II in 1787. He sold half the land and kept approximately 777 acres for use as a farm. Crops grown at Sully included wheat, corn, timothy, and clover. Of the nearly 40 enslaved African Americans, approximately 80% were field workers, while 20% were house servants. During the Lees' occupancy of Sully, there are four known incidents of escapes. These incidents are documented through Lee letters and run-away advertisements. In one case, Beaver Ludwell did return to Sully, accompanied by his wife Nancy. When the Lees left Sully in 1811, many of the bondsmen were sold as part of the property. Others accompanied the Lees to their new home in Alexandria."

    "ABSTRACT":"On 31 May 1858, on the James River, the schooner Keziah, out of Wilmington, Delaware, was overtaken by Petersburg officials who arrested the captain, William Baylis, and his mate, and took away the five runaway slaves hidden below on the Keziah. So many people crowded into to the Petersburg Court House for the trial of Baylis that it had to be postponed twice. Despite the services of two of the city's most outstanding lawyers, Baylis was found guilty and sent to the penitentiary. Baylis was an important figure in the Underground Railroad, well known to such leaders as William Still and Thomas Garrett, and his arrest and conviction, which made news across the nation, provides a rare glimpse into the operations of the Underground Railroad in eastern Virginia. For the citizens of Petersburg, too, the Keziah affair made the court house, as the Petersburg Daily Express exclaimed, \"the theatre of the most intensely exciting event that has ever transpired within [the city's] limits.\""

Walker gained fame after his attempted journey in 1844 to help seven freedom seekers to gain their freedom by sailing them south to the Caribbean. Walker was caught, subjected to jail time, and branded with an \"SS\" for \"Slave Stealer\" as mandated by the federal courts. He built his residence in Wisconsin in 1855 and lived there until moving to Michigan to live out his remaining years in 1863. Given the nature of the Underground Railroad a precise number is hard to ascertain, but it is thought that Walker helped hundreds of slaves gain their freedom throughout his lifetime."

    "ABSTRACT":"The gravesite of Mary Ellen Pleasant, called \"Mother of Civil Rights in California,\" is nominated. Born a freed slave, Pleasant was indentured (after being freed) to abolitionist Quakers and later worked with William Lloyd Garrison and William Still. She became an Underground Railroad slave rescuer in New Bedford, OH, and New Orleans. Escaping capture as a rescuer, she moved to San Francisco (1852) and worked covertly to rescue fugitive slaves, becoming known as \"the Western Terminus of the Underground Railroad.\" Pleasant worked with the Franchise League of Miflin Gibbs, the Fugitive-slave trials of Archy Lee, and support abolitionist John Brown by purchasing land for a slave refuge in Chatham Ontario (West), giving him money for arms, and alerting VA slaves of his plan. She also actively worked on the Chatham Vigilance Committee on the Demerest fugitive slave case. Later in San Francisco, she became a philanthropist and employed blacks, backed them in business, and opened doors of employment for them and women in homes and hotels and on coastal steamers and trains. She led tests of 1863 Civil Rights Laws, using a precedent-setting Trolley case used in 1982 to gain monies for pain and suffering in a civil-rights case."

Blanche Bruce is significant to the Underground Railroad because he was born enslaved on March 1, 1854, near Farmville, in Prince Edward County, Virginia, and escaped from slavery in Missouri to freedom in Kansas during the Civil War. Like Frederick Douglass (his friend), Bruce showed the public distinction a formerly enslaved person could attain, given educational, economic, and political opportunities. This house in Washington, D.C., is where he lived after the Civil War while serving in the Senate."

    "ABSTRACT":"As the site of Delaware's legislative chambers, judicial courtroom, and executive office, Delaware's State House on The Green in Dover became the critical focal point in the life of Samuel D. Burris, an educated free Black man from nearby Willow Grove in Kent County, Delaware. Beginning with legislation enacted in February 1837 by the Senate and House of Representatives that set forth penalties for those caught assisting the escape of enslaved people, to the arrest and trial of Samuel Burris ten years later, to the refusal of the Governor to intervene in the case despite the pleas of noted abolitionists, the State House provided the backdrop for an incredible story of steadfast allegiance. Samuel Burris' jail cell was a scant 100 yards from the State House. The steps of the historic building then provided the setting for the dramatic moment when the law was played out, resulting in the auction of Burris into servitude, according to the 1837 statute. What the law did not provide for was the ironic means used by abolitionists to gain and ensure the freedom of the documented Conductor who was described by William Still in Underground Railroad as an \"accredited agent\"."

The original 1732 court is built over the ruins of Delaware's first courthouse of 1689, with additions and modifications throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. Significant trials and events took place at the court including the escape of a runaway enslaved family aided by abolitionist and UGRR stationmaster Thomas Garrett. Here Garrett, and fellow UGRR stationmaster, John Hunn, were tried and convicted in Federal court for violation of the Fugitive Slave Acts. Now, as a public museum, visitors learn about Delaware's colonial and early state history, courts and government. Featured are tours, exhibits and educational programs on Delaware's courts and Assembly, UGRR and abolitionist, period furniture, portraits, artifacts, documents, architecture, and archaeology."

    "ABSTRACT":"Established in 1987 and located in the Star Hill AME Church, the Star Hill Museum displays and interprets the history of this antebellum free African American community in Kent County as a vehicle for teaching the lessons of slavery and African-American history to the youth of today. Star Hill was a noted stop on the Underground Railroad, according to the family traditions in the community and in the nearby Camden Quaker community. Museum displays focus on teaching about slavery and the role this community and others nearby played in the Underground Railroad. Exhibits, featuring images of people and places important in the Underground Railroad, collections of local history reminiscences, and a reproduction of a slave quarter, were originally put up in the church dining hall. The museum has grown to fill an addition to the church. Visited by hundreds of people annually, a tour of sites important in the Underground Railroad in the central Kent County area is offered by the Museum"

    "ABSTRACT":"Fort Jefferson, the central cultural feature of Dry Tortugas National Park, lies 68 nautical miles west of Key West, Florida. Thirty years in the making (1846-1875), Fort Jefferson ranks as one of the largest coastal forts ever built, covering nearly 17 acres. Enslaved Africans were instrumental in the construction of Fort Jefferson. Despite its remote location (the fort is only accessible by boat or seaplane), seven enslaved Africans attempted to escape from the fort in 1847. In 1862, Fort Jefferson, now occupied by Union Forces, discontinued the use of slave labor when the commanding officer, Col. Joseph S. Morgan of the 90th New York Infantry, declared all enslaved laborers liberated from their owners. On April 18, 1863, the slave rolls at Fort Jefferson were officially discontinued, though legally the fort was in Federal control and therefore exempt from the provisions of the Emancipation Proclamation. Fort Jefferson and Dry Tortugas National Park are only accessible by boat or seaplane. "

    "ABSTRACT":"The Denmark Congregational Church in Denmark, Iowa, organized in 1838, is the oldest Congregational Church west of the Mississippi River. Part of the current building was constructed in 1845. The New England Congregationalists who settled Denmark called Reverend Asa Turner from Quincy, Illinois, to be their minister. Turner was well known there for his anti-slavery activities. From the beginning, the church and its members actively worked against slavery. Church records from March 22, 1856 state \"it has been the habit of the church since the first, to hold also on the last Sabbath evening of each month, a prayer meeting in behalf of the slave and a collection frequently to assist in the deliverance of the same.\" Documentation and local tradition have church members actively involved in the Underground Railroad. The first Anti-Slavery Society in Iowa was established here on January 1, 1840, by church members and Reverend Turner. This early and continuing role established the Denmark Congregational Church as the leader in the anti-slavery movement in Eastern Iowa."

The cemetery is adjacent to the site where Dr. Ira Blanchard and his family had a homestead. Dr. Ira Blanchard was an abolitionist who moved to southwestern Iowa with friends from Oberlin, Ohio in the 1840's. The group attempted to set up a society where all people would be free to start a new life. Along with being the town physician, Dr. Blanchard served as a bondsman to allow blacks to set up residence in the town. According to oral history historical documents, Blanchard's residence was used as a safe house and Blanchard served as a conductor. The site should be commemorated both for the work Dr. Blanchard did during his lifetime, as well as the site where Blanchard and his family are now laid to rest."

    "ABSTRACT":"During the pre-Civil war era of the 1840's and 1850's a small settlement of Quakers located in Salem, Henry County, Iowa Territory, banded together to help runaway slaves find their way to freedom. The Lewelling, Gibson, and Shriner houses, along with the Beehive and Henderson Hotel formed a network of stations on the Underground Railroad. The Lewelling Quaker Museum is the only building still intact and is a well-preserved two story, yellow stone house listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Evidence of Underground Railroad activity in this town is corroborated by the lawsuit, Ruell Daggs vs. Elihu Frazier, et al. Other supporting documents consist of written reminiscences of O. A. Garretson and Rachel Kellum, as well as a newspaper advertisement for runaway slaves. The role these abolitionists played created a split within the Quaker community causing them to be disowned and allocated a separate section in the Salem South Cemetery. The Lewelling house was purchased by five men in 1960 and opened to the public in 19621. Today, the museum offers tours to local school children and visitors from across the nation."

    "ABSTRACT":"An estimated 300 - 700 escaped slaves lived in New Bedford between the mid -1840s and 1860. New Bedford was attractive to escaping slaves from the south for many reasons. The whaling industry made the city both wealthy and in constant need of labor. The city was an active part of a coastal trading system that regularly traded manufactured goods for raw goods in southern ports €providing opportunities for escaping slaves to stow away amid ships' cargoes.\"Quakers, who controlled the city's political and economic life into the 1820s, had taken an early stand against slavery and helped build anti-slavery sentiment in New Bedford. The city also had a large population of color that was very involved in anti-slavery activity since at least the 1820s. Discovering New Bedford's Underground Railroad History takes park visitors on a mile journey from New Bedford's waterfront, through the cobblestone streets of the historic district and to the first free home of Frederick Douglass after his escape from slavery in 1838. The program explores the alluring factors that contributed to New Bedford becoming a haven for escaped slaves and uncovers some of the untold stories from our nation's past."

Throughout its history a private home, the site was from 1840 until his death, the home of Hart Leavitt (1808 - 1881). Written history of Wilbur Seibert references private letters that indicate Hart Leavitt was an operator on the Underground Railroad, and received runaway slaves at his home, assisting their safe passage to freedom. Other members of the Leavitt family were also active in the abolition movement. Father Roger Leavitt, was a wealthy landowner, active in public service, and an ardent abolitionist. Roger Hooker Leavitt, a brother, also of Charlemont, provided a home for 5 years to Basil Dorsey, a runaway slave who came to Charlemont through abolitionist connections sometime around 1838. Another brother Joshua Leavitt of New York, was editor of the New York and then Boston based abolitionist publication, the Emancipator, and assisted the passage of Basil Dorsey to Charlemont. The Leavitt family played a significant but by no means solitary role in the active anti-slavery movement in the Town of Charlemont and Franklin County."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Roger Hooker (1805 -1855) and Keziah Leavitt site is today a building on the campus of the Academy at Charlemont. Corroborating written histories indicate the site, served for 5 years as safe haven for Basil Dorsey, a runaway slave from Maryland (and defendant in one of notorious fugitive slave cases in history). Other members of the Leavitt family were also active in the abolition movement. Father Roger Leavitt, was a wealthy landowner, active in public service, and an ardent abolitionist. Brother Hart Leavitt was an operator on the Underground Railroad, and received runaway slaves at his home, assisting their safe passage to freedom. Another brother Joshua Leavitt of New York, was editor of the New York and then Boston based abolitionist publication, the Emancipator, and also assisted the passage of Basil Dorsey to Charlemont. Documentation supports both that Basil Dorsey, his wife Louisa, and their 2 children came to the Leavitt home through abolitionist connections sometime around 1838. Though Basil's wife Louisa (and Keziah Leavitt as well) died in November 1838, records indicate Basil Dorsey continued to live with Roger Hooker Leavitt and his next wife Eliza (sister to Keziah) until moving to Florence, Massachusetts in 1844."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Belair Mansion is the ca. 1745 Georgian brick plantation house of Maryland's colonial governor Samuel Ogle and his wife Anne Tasker Ogle. Over a century and a quarter of Ogles and Taskers made this their home, concluding in 1871. Inventories reveal that at least 50 bondsmen were at Belair at any period of time, and list names, ages, and sometimes occupation. We learn of individuals such as \"Negro Pompey 56\" worth 10 pounds in 1775, or \"Cser, 25,hired to Mr. Buchanan\" and \"Phyllis, too old to be worth anything\" in 1815 or \"Peggy , infant, infirm\" for $40.75 and \"Hercules, a carpenter\" in 1844. Glimpses into the relationships of the owners (\"Negores [sic] who have alliances at Belair....may be sold with wife and husband\") contrast with slaves choosing their own destinies. In 1744 Governor Ogle's \"Negro Joe...his cook\" went off on a boat to Philadelphia. Shoemaker Tom was in 1775 \"probably concealed...by some white people who make too familiar with my slaves.\" Liberated by soldiers in 1814, another \"Tom\" departed Belair with the British troops. \"Dennis\" with good teeth and whiskers ran off in 1852. This history of humans bound and humans seeking their freedom is told in the exhibit \"African American Slaves at Belair.\""

It was the pre-Civil War home of Associate Justice of the US Supreme Court Gabriel Duvall (1811-1834) and subsequently his heirs.Itwas a profitable plantation dependent on its enslaved labor. Newspaper records indicate that at least2 of the bondsmen (Frank and Joe) attempted to escape between 1814 and 1859. Throughout his life, Judge Duvall was primarily a public servant. The labor provided by his enslaved workforce enabled him to lead the life of a prosperous country gentleman as well. The most valuable personal property recorded in his inventory at the time of his death were his 37 enslaved African Americans. Marietta is currently owned by the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, Prince George's County Department of Parks and Recreation and is open to the public as Marietta House Museum."

    "ABSTRACT":"The nominated site is the final resting place (grave site) of abolitionist, Jonathan Walker, includes a monument dedicated to \"The Man with the Branded Hand.\" Born on a farm in Harwich, Mass., March 22, 1799 Walker as a young boy became a sailor. By 1835 he had advanced to a ship captain and owner of his own vessel. Captain Walker joined abolitionist, Benjamin Lundy's, effort to colonized colored citizens who has escaped from American slavery in Mexico. He used his vessel helping fugitive escape from slavery. In 1844 while taking 7 blacks from Florida to the Bahamas and freedom, Walker's boat was captured by authorities. He was charged with slave stealing and imprisoned for a year. After a lengthy trial he was tried and convicted for slave stealing. Walker was sentenced to be placed in the pillory and was branded SS (Slave Stealer) in his right hand. His trial is one of the most famous in US History during the slave era. Thereafter, Walker became known as the \"Them Man with the Branded Hand.\" However, rather than \"Slave stealer,\" Walker became known among abolitionist, anti-slavery and underground railroad workers as \"Slave Savior.\" He then devoted himself to lecturing on Anti-Slavery subjects around the country. In 1863, Captain Walker purchased farm land at Lake Harbor in Muskegon County, MI, where he lived until his death, April 30, 1878. Having been informed that the family could not afford a suitable monument to his memory, a fellow abolitionist, Rev. Photius Fiske, Chaplain in the U.S. N. from Boston, Mass., generously offered to provide one at his own personal expense. The monument was installed in July. An elaborate ceremony and unveiling of the monument was held on the first day of August €œ the Emancipation Day of the West Indies. The attendance was the largest ever seen in Muskegon. Thousands attended with over 500 coming from other states and cities, arriving by steamer from Chicago to Grand Haven. A detailed report of the event appeared in the August 2, 1878 issue of the Muskegon Chronicle under the heading \"A Hero Honored.\""

In Ann Arbor, visitors see the founding site of the Michigan Anti-Slavery Society (1836) and the place where the Liberty Party's Signal of Liberty newspaper was printed. Close by is the home of Reverend Guy Beckley who edited the anti-slavery newspaper and admitted to sheltering escaping slaves. His house is listed in the NPS Network to Freedom Program. Along the Chicago to Detroit road several men conspired to hide escaping slaves and carry them to Canada. The story of African American Asher Aray helping a group of 27 to Canada was recently uncovered and is revealed during the tour. The tours give a human face to those who worked individually and collectively to escape slavery. The carefully researched tour sites are presented by professional guides with a hope that visitors will have a more comprehensive understanding of the role of Washtenaw County citizens in opposing slavery and emancipating enslaved African Americans. Tours are offered June-August and by arrangement."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Edenton, NC waterfront served as a departure point for the Maritime Underground Railroad. This network was developed in North Carolina by African-American watermen who were able to arrange passage to northern states for fugitive slaves through their knowledge and expertise in maritime activities. One well-documented example is Harriet Jacob's account of her 1842 escape from Edenton by ship. Her escape was arranged by a waterman named Peter. Jacobs describes in \"Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, Written by Herself\", the arrangements Peter made in advance, how plans to transport her to a waiting ship were carried out, her fear of being found out, and her thankfulness when disembarking in Philadelphia that her friend Peter had correctly judged the ship captain's character. This example is not only of one individual's escape to freedom, but also of the network that existed making that escape possible. Jacobs' autobiography was published in 1861 with names and places changed. In 1987, the actual names of characters were authenticated and found to have been residents of Edenton, NC."

    "ABSTRACT":"The brick building built in the 1830's in Fairhaven, Ohio. The building is one of Ohio's most intact representations of \"pike town\" architecture closely associated with pre-Civil War, horse powered turnpike transportation and lodging. The building served a multitude of uses in the 19th century including: hotel, restaurant, tavern, stagecoach stop, general store, post office, station on the Underground Railroad and home to Gabriel \"Old Gabe\" Smith, a former slave and conductor on the Underground Railroad. The building is located on five acres on the banks of the Four Mile Creek and adjacent to the old Hamilton-Fairhaven-Richmond Turnpike. This turnpike, built in the 1830's-1840's, was the major route between Cincinnati and Richmond, Indiana, when the Northwest Territory was being settled and was a well known route on the Underground Railroad between Cincinnati and Fountain City, Indiana, where Levi Coffin, President of the Underground Railroad, lived for many years. Runaway slaves would travel up the Four Mile Creek and enter the back of the Bunker Hill Tavern for refuge as they journeyed toward Canada and freedom."

    "ABSTRACT":"The King Cemetery in Delta, Ohio memorializes Rev. William King, founder of the historic Elgin Settlement (North Buxton), Ontario, a major destination points for freedom seekers escaping enslavement in the US. Although Rev. King is not buried in the cemetery, a nineteenth century memorial stone was placed there by family members. It reads \"Sacred to the Memory of Wm.King. For the Sake of his family, William permitted his earthly remains to lye [sic] in a foreign land.\" The cemetery represents a small portion of the original 640 King homestead in Delta, where Rev. King and fifteen formerly enslaved individuals (who he had manumitted) over-wintered on their way to Ontario where they established the Elgin Settlement."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Oberlin Heritage Center/O.H.I.O. is a complex of historic sites that offers tours, educational programs and special events throughout the year that present Oberlin history to the public. The organization offers an annual Living History Open House with living history performers telling the story of the Oberlin-Wellington Rescue (1858). The tour presents information on the history of abolition and the Underground Railroad in the community and includes the home of abolitionist James Monroe and the one room schoolhouse where African American and Caucasian children studied together in open defiance of Ohio's Black Laws. The organization offers periodic programs and exhibits on topics related to the Underground Railroad. For example, in 2004, there will be a February program on A Children's View of the Underground Railroad and the organization is co-sponsoring a re-enactment of the Lane Debates entitled The Lane Debates: The Making of Radical Abolition and the Oberlin Commitment to Racial Egalitarianism. Previous speakers have included James Horton of George Washington University (who presented a series of lectures on the Underground Railroad in conjunction with an exhibition from the Gilder Lehrman Institute entitled Free at Last: A History of the Abolition of Slavery in America in September 2000), William and Aimee Lee Cheek of San Diego State University (on John Mercer Langston; 1998) and various scholars in conjunction with Threads of Freedom: The Underground Railroad Story through Quilts exhibition and symposium in summer 2001 including Sharon Patton, now director of the National Museum of African American Art at the Smithsonian."

Also Mary Edmonson, one of those attempting to flee slavery on the ship the Pearl in Washington, D.C., in 1848, died in Oberlin while she was working her way through the Oberlin Prep Division, and was buried in the cemetery. There is a new monument to replace the stone removed for a runaway child who died at age four while in Oberlin, OH."

    "ABSTRACT":"In the America we envision, The Historical Society of Pennsylvania engages and enriches all who read, watch films, interact with people of different origins, and explore the Philadelphia region and Pennsylvania. We do so through the histories that we document and illuminate. To bring history to the people and the people to history, The Historical Society of Pennsylvania works to expand American history's documentation, accessibility, and use. Founded in 1824 and significantly augmented in 2002 by The Balch Institute for Ethnic Studies, the Society serves as a vital gateway to historical resources and understanding for educators and researchers, regional heritage preservationists and presenters, and community history partners. The Society preserves and explores the origins, diversity, and development of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and the nation as one of the great repositories of United States history, as the preeminent library of Pennsylvania, and as a distinguished publisher and educator. The Society's collections on the Underground Railroad and slavery, subjects pivotal to this nation's history and integral to our holdings, document their roles not only in America's social fabric, but in its psyche as well."

    "ABSTRACT":"In 1745, the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly ordered their clerk to obtain copies of statutes, maps and other works from England. By this action, Benjamin Franklin, the Clerk of the Colonial Assembly, was instrumental in the creation of the State Library of Pennsylvania. The library that evolved from those beginnings is the largest and most complete collection of Pennsylvania publications to be found anywhere. The oldest materials actually predate the founding of the Commonwealth, while the newest materials include the current publications of the various agencies. The library's primary missions are to serve the informational and research needs of the government of the Commonwealth and to serve as a resource library for all public, academic, school and special libraries in Pennsylvania. It is charged with maintaining a definitive collection of publications of all agencies of the Commonwealth and serves as a Regional Depository for United States Government Publications. The State Library has an extensive Law Collection that houses the laws, regulations, and higher court decisions of the U.S. government and all fifty states. The collection is especially strong in Pennsylvania newspapers, law, history, and genealogy."

This site commemorates a significant Union victory that was critical to the legitimacy of the Emancipation Proclamation, which was a critical step in the transformation of the war into a campaign to end slavery. The Union occupation of Murfreesboro also provided a route to freedom for those enslaved in the area. Many of the formerly enslaved quickly took up arms to fight for their freedom in the United States Colored Troops."

    "ABSTRACT":"This program portrays the essence of a woman whose objective in life was to assist those less fortunate and the Underground Railroad theme or message in this presentation is \"people helping people\". This program expresses that the only way to Ëœtrue freedom' is Ëœknowledge', and the audiences, especially students, are encouraged to READ EVERYDAY. Yet another message is the one which pleads with attendees to Ëœturn around and give back', by teaching someone to read and/or write. As a \"conductor\" on the Underground Railroad, Harriet's work has been extensively documented in biographies, histories of the Underground Railroad, children's literature, and newspaper, magazine and encyclopedia articles. Accounts of how many trips she made and how many slaves she led to freedom differ, but the danger and hardships she and the other \"freedom seekers\" experienced cannot be disputed. The stories of fleeing at night, hiding in the fields and ditches, being hunted down by bloodhounds, and riding under cargo in wagons are too numerous to be recounted here, yet these stories are told over and over again within this presentation. Melissa Waddy-Thibodeaux, today's Conductor on the Underground Reading Railroad and her company of re-enactors have committed their lives to educating via theatrics."

    "ABSTRACT":"The nominated cemetery site of The Black Seminole Scouts is located outside the small town of Brackettville, Texas. Persecuted by the U.S. Army and slave hunters, the black Seminoles and their families had traveled on the Trail of Tears from Florida to Indian Territory in Oklahoma and finally to Sonora, Mexico, where they were finally free from persecution and re-enslavement. By this time the Seminole maroons had gained a reputation on the U.S/Mexican border as fierce fighters and Indian trackers. After the Civil War they were asked by the U.S. Army to return to Texas and serve as scouts at the Fort Clark Reservation at Bracketville. Included in the group were runaway slaves and their families to whom they had given refuge on their journeys to freedom. Subsequently, the black Seminoles were to play a major role in defending the Texas borderlands between 1872 and 1914. Generations of black Seminole families are buried here in the cemetery and it has become a pilgramage site for descendants."

Many people are unaware of this unique American who gave up his Southern aristocratic birthright to stand by his convictions and advocate for individual rights and freedom. He led over 30 souls to freedom while his two brothers were in the Confederate army. It is hoped in the future to create the Moncure Conway Foundation that will be instrumental in interpreting the home and life of Moncure Conway, also making the site more open to the public."

    "ABSTRACT":"Mary Ellen Pleasant, the 19th-century activist and Civil Rights heroine now called \"The Mother of Civil Rights in California\" was born enslaved and rose to become an operative on the Underground Railroad, the Western Terminus of that network of freedom seekers, and a multi-millionairess. Her daring story is enacted in a three-part historical program (Chautauqua) by scholar/performer Susheel Bibbs all over the U.S. Having uncovered Pleasant's lost memoirs and letters and thoroughly researched her life, Bibbs, who is a scholar for the California Council for the Humanities and a lecturer for the University of California, Berkeley, uses Pleasant's own words and song. The uplifting, unsung story can be accompanied by an exhibit and book sale, each created by Susheel Bibbs. Pleasant's work took on a national face when she aided the abolitionist John Brown in his failed raid at Harpers Ferry, which formed the first blow of the Civil War. Her 1868 decision in the California State Supreme Court set precedent that aided modern-day Civil Rights. Pleasant's story inspires and transcends boundaries of race, class, and color.

    "ABSTRACT":"Ponce de Leon named this area \"Cape of Florida\" when he led the first Spanish expedition to Florida in 1513. The island served as a secret meeting place and port for freedom seekers and Black Seminoles waiting to rendezvous with sea captains or board dugouts for a passage to safety in the British Bahamas. In the early 1820’s, enslaved Africans, runaways and Black Seminoles sought freedom on Key Biscayne. They met with the captains of small ships (known as \"sloops\") from the British Bahamas who offered transportation across the gulf stream. In 1821, some 300 freedom seekers bartered for passage aboard 27 sloops, or chose to sail Indian dugout canoes the 107 miles to Andros Island in the Bahamas. The construction of the lighthouse by the federal government in 1825 effectively blocked the escape route. The Cape Florida lighthouse was completed in 1825, but was damaged during the Second Seminole War. The rebuilt tower, completed in 1846, remains the oldest standing structure in Miami-Dade County. Although the lighthouse was built to save lives and ships, its unflinching light brought an end to this avenue of escape for freedom seekers. "

    "ABSTRACT":"The Congregational Church was founded in 1833 by 32 men and women who desired a free church under no higher ecclesiastical body. All those joining this church were persons with strong anti-slavery beliefs. The community called the church \"the Abolition Church\" which was not a compliment in Jacksonville which had been settled by many persons from the South. The first pastor was Rev. William Carter who had graduated from Yale. He was a member of the \"Yale Band\", a group of new graduates of Yale College who had signed a contract to come to Illinois to find a seminary of learning and found churches. In 1829, the first of these young men arrived. Julian Sturtevant was the first professor of Illinois College which was built on a hill just west of Jacksonville. The leaders of the Congregational Church became the leaders in the UGRR as runaway slaves made their way north from St. Louis. The church welcomed persons of color and on its membership role were three black women, one of whom this church helped to rescue from slavery. Since the UGRR was illegal there is no direct mention of it in the official records of the church. However, the records do note that money was given to Emily Logan to help pay for her legal defense as she petitioned the courts to win her freedom. Fortunately, we have a record from other sources which document the UGRR activity. Many of those involved were members of this church. They worked closely with Ben Henderson and David Spencer, two free black men who did most of the driving for the UGRR. The Congregational Church is still a strong supporter of peace and justice issues in our world."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Old Slave House outside Equality, Illinois, is the last standing station on the Reverse U.G.R.R. Started by salt maker John Hart Crenshaw in 1838, the home's third floor attic contains 12 rooms long believed to be where Crenshaw operated a secret slave jail for kidnapped free black and captured runaway slaves. A grand jury indicted Crenshaw for kidnapping, once in the mid 1820s (the outcome unknown) and again in 1842 when a trial jury acquitted him. The case's victims, Maria Adams and her seven or eight children, ended up as slaves in Texas. In 1828, Crenshaw took Frank Granger and 15 others downriver to Tipton Co., Tennessee, and sold them as slaves. Crenshaw also kidnapped Lucinda and her children in 1828. She ended up in Barren Co., Kentucky. Contemporary letters identifying Crenshaw's role back both cases. Crenshaw also kidnapped Peter White and three others in the 1840s. They were sold into slavery in Arkansas, but later rescued. Stories of strange noises upstairs coming from victims, date to 1851. Despite accounts that the rooms were slave quarters, Crenshaw family stories indicate a distinction between the plantation's household servants and field hands, and the victim's of Crenshaw's criminal activities.\n\nThe site is owned by the State of Illinois and is currently closed to the public."

Dr. Samuel left Maine for Ohio in 1810 with his step brother Andrew Coombs, Jr. These families developed an UGRR Station that connected with John Rankin in Ripley Co. and Levi Coffin in Hamilton Co. Dr. Samuel and his four sons moved to Jefferson Co. Indiana in 1840 and continued their UGRR work in Madison and Lancaster. Dr. Samuel's leadership helped start Eleutherian College where all races could receive an education. Dr. Samuel Tibbets and family helped operate the UGRR movement in Jefferson Co. working with several free African American UGRR conductors such as George DeBaptiste and Elijah Anderson. There was also a family tie with Lyman Hoyt and these families worked the UGRR without ever being caught. Dr. Samuel Tibbets grandsons helped build Eleutherian College. Dr. Samuel Tibbets was an outstanding leader in Lancaster and played a huge part in fighting slavery in many different ways. His leadership in Eleutherian College made education available to many African Americans that had escaped from slavery. Dr. Samuel Tibbets life work helped change our Nation."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Georgetown District, located in Madison, Indiana on the Ohio River became home to African Americans as early as the 1830s, eventually developing into a network of Underground Railroad conductors and stations. Georgetown, located just five blocks from the Ohio River, became a place in which many freedom seekers found a community of safe houses and conductors willing to give them aid to reach the next station toward freedom. This neighborhood became the center for the Underground Railroad activity of Madison as well as the focal point for the Kentucky mobs who attempted to disband this community. The unique feature about this neighborhood is that the homes, churches, and environment that the freedom seekers, conductors, and abolitionists saw still exist today. The two Underground Railroad associated churches still stand, as do the homes of several UGRR leaders. The neighborhood retains a high historical integrity for the period of significance (1820-1865); 64% of the original structures still stand."

    "ABSTRACT":"To allow abolitionist settlers a friendly port on the Missouri River, the Free State landing of Quindaro was opened in January of 1857. The town was dramatically successful at first, but lost a bid for the County seat in 1859, and declined, loosing its charter in 1862. From the start, Quindaro operated an Underground Railroad, built on anti-slavery sentiments of the Wyandot Tribe who removed to the area in 1843. Geographically positioned on the Missouri River border facing pro-slavery territory, Quindaro served as an intentional and strategic link in the Eastern Kansas Underground Railroad network. Written documents and oral histories illustrate how a cluster of stations and conductors assisted escaping slaves into and out of Quindaro, often using the Parkville, Missouri escape route. Town residents actively assisted kidnapping victims who faced capture and sale to slave dealers. The town hosted an ultimately unsuccessful challenge to voting laws that restricted blacks from the polls. The history of the Underground Railroad at Quindaro has been traced from 1857 through 1864. The maroon community of Negro Town at the Upper Sandusky, Ohio Wyandot reserve is explored for indications of a potential origin of the Underground Railroad among the Wyandots."

Smith, a mulatto, is believed to have arrived in Boston from Philadelphia in 1836 and quickly became involved in abolitionist activities and an officer in all three of Boston's vigilance committees. Employed as a waiter at the Mount Washington House, Smith encountered notable figures such as Charles Sumner, Francis Gould Shaw, William Lloyd Garrison, and Theodore Parker. By the late 1840s, Smith established his own successful catering business in which he employed and harbored numerous fugitives and kept a watchful eye on slave agents in Boston. Smith became a confidant of Sumner and assisted him in raising funds to erect a monument to the Massachusetts 54th Regiment, as well as advising him on drafting the Civil Rights Act of 1875. He was elected to the state legislature in 1873. Smith purchased the Cambridge House in 1852 and resided there with his wife, Emeline, until his death in 1879."

    "ABSTRACT":"On August 8, 1850, a hired carriage was forcibly stopped in the middle of the Georgetown Pike (Georgia Avenue) at the DC-Maryland border by a Sheriff's posse from Washington, D.C. There was a gun fight. The carriage, driven by William Chaplin, was carrying two men attempting to escape from enslavement respectively owned by two Southern Congressmen. Chaplin was arrested and the bondsmen recovered. William Chaplin was an Underground Railroad operative who had come to DC in 1845. He was associated with the Liberty party and the Albany Vigilance Committee. He is known to have aided African Americans, both free and enslaved, in legal endeavors and in escaping to freedom. Since there was originally some dispute over whether the arrest took place in DC or in Maryland, Chaplin was imprisoned in Washington for six weeks and released on $6000 bond. He was subsequently imprisoned in Rockville, Maryland, for 13 weeks and released on $19,000 bond. Chaplin left the area, forfeiting the bond, and never came to trial. The exact site of the arrest has been ascertained by the descriptions in the National Intelligencer article, the \"Appeal\" by the Chaplin Committee, and a visit to the site."

    "ABSTRACT":"This is a 1.5 mile trail interpreted to be used as a self-guided hike through woods and fields that would recreate, at least in part, the experience of escaping on the Underground Railroad. The trail begins at a historic brick house built by a Quaker in 1800. The site has ample parking and is publicly owned. There is a unique stone barn near the house that will eventually be converted to a visitor center for the Montgomery County Underground Railroad/ Quaker Heritage Cluster. The trail ends at a spring that was used by farms on the outskirts of a Quaker town settled in the 1720s and names for the spring, Sandy Spring. As much as possible, the trail is made to resemble a trail in the 1800s with native plants, natural surfaces, a replica wooden bridge over a creek, and no sign of modern life. The terrain includes woodlands, a steep descent to a creek, and a cultivated field. The trail is interpreted with a kiosk at the trailhead, modest signage, and a handout. The trail is not handicapped-accessible, but is intended for use by all ages."

    "ABSTRACT":"In the Elizabeth City/Pasquotank County region of the northeast North Carolina, maritime Underground Railroad operations were active on the Pasquotank River. These activities were comprised of a network of free and enslaved blacks, many being seamen themselves. Together they worked with citizens of other races and various occupations to identify sympathetic watermen to arrange safe passage on vessels and ships for those who sought freedom from human bondage."

    "ABSTRACT":"Matilda Joslyn Gage, best known as a woman's suffrage leader (coauthor with Stanton and Anthony of the History of Woman Suffrage, officer of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, editor of the National Citizen and Ballot Box, and author of Woman, Church, and State) was also an Underground Railroad supporter, part of the network affiliated with Rev. Jermain Loguen, AME Zion minister in Syracuse, N.Y. She recalled that she was one of only two people in Fayetteville, N.Y., to offer her help to Loguen. Helen Leslie Gage, Matilda's eldest daughter, noted that one of her \"earliest remembrances is that of a black man on his knees before her mother, thanking her for a chance of life and liberty.\" Daughter Julia Gage Carpenter asserted that the home had been an Underground Railroad station and that, despite threats, her mother continued to shelter slaves until the close of the Civil War. Granddaughter Matilda Jewell Gage, 12 years old when her grandmother died, noted that both Gage's father's home and Gage's own home were stations on the Underground Railroad. Lucy Seward Noble, a prominent Fayetteville resident and contemporary of Gage, identified the Gage house as an Underground Railroad site in her Reminiscences."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Onondaga Historical Association Museum (OHA) is the primary history agency for the greater Syracuse, New York Community. OHA opened a professionally researched and designed permanent multi-media exhibit in September of 2003 entitled, Freedom Bound: The Story of Syracuse, The Underground Railroad. Both the broad context and particular stories of local Underground Railroad actions are interpreted through period graphics, original artifacts, and a \"sound, light\" object theater presentation. Adjacent to the exhibit is the museum auditorium which also now features a 23-minute video entitled, The Jerry Rescue: Syracuse Defies the Fugitive Slave Law. Through a combination of live drama with historical images, this production interprets the 1851 rescue in Syracuse of a fugitive slave named William \"Jerry\" Henry, one of the most famous public actions of the Underground Railroad in the nation at the time. The OHA is now recognized as the focus for public interpretation of Syracuse's Underground Railroad story. Although primary documentation of Underground Railroad activities is always limited, OHA's collection also includes various church records, individual letters, numerous period newspaper articles and other first person accounts that both attest to local Underground Railroad activity or help provide vital clues and connections for further research."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Haines House was the home of J. Ridgeway and Sarah Grant Haines. They were Quaker farmers who raised six children in the house built by her father, John Grant, between 1830 and 1842. Ridgeway, Sarah and John were among the many active Abolitionists in northeast Ohio, and members of the Western Anti-Slavery Society, headquartered in nearby Salem. At least two large Abolitionist gatherings were held on the grounds of their 126-acre farm, and Abby Kelley Foster, Stephen Foster, and Parker Pillsbury were houseguests. According to family stories, they hid fugitive slaves in the small attic room above the kitchen of the house. The House remained in the Haines family until 1904. In the 1920s, the house was converted into two apartments and remained as such until 1966 when a local college professor purchased it and restored its classic features. It is listed on National Register of Historic Places, the Ohio Historic Inventory and was the Alliance's first official \"Designated Landmark.\" The House was sold in 1994 to owners who left it empty and it fell into disrepair. The Alliance Area Preservation Society purchased the home in 2001 and has begun efforts to fully restore the building."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Norfolk waterfront was a busy stop on the Underground Railroad. Virginia's last Royal Governor made Norfolk a major refuge for runaways when he issued a 1775 proclamation promising freedom to all slaves who joined him to fight with the British Army. Some 800 fugitives enlisted. Eighteenth and nineteenth century runaway slave advertisements indicate that Norfolk's waterfront continued to be a destination for fugitives from southeastern Virginia and northeastern North Carolina throughout the ante-bellum years. Two of the South's most famous fugitives, George Latimer and Shadrach Minkins, made their escape from Norfolk. Certain ships' captains were known in the underground community to be sympathetic to runaways, or at least agreeable to transporting them secretly for a price. Of the approximately ninety former local slaves interviewed or referenced by William Still of the Philadelphia Vigilance Committee (The Underground Railroad, 1872), the majority reported escape by ship from the Norfolk waterfront. Many credited Captain William D. Bayliss of the Keziah or Captain Fountain of the City of Richmond with aiding them. The City of Richmond is known to have customarily tied up in Norfolk at the wharf belonging to John Higgins, a one-time owner of Shadrach Minkins."

    "ABSTRACT":"The West Virginia State Archives (WVSA) seeks to collect, preserve and disseminate information about the history of the state and its people. West Virginia became a state during the Civil War, after Virginia joined the Confederacy and western counties chose to remain in the Union. Though much less prevalent in western counties than in other parts of Virginia, slavery did exist in West Virginia prior to the Civil War, with bondsmen accounting for more than 10 percent of the populations of six counties in 1860. Slavery was most prevalent in Jefferson County, where abolitionist John Brown led a raid on the Federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry in 1859 in a failed attempt to launch a slave rebellion. The West Virginia State Archives collects books, periodicals, maps, state government records, manuscripts, photographs, audiovisual materials, microfilm, and special collections materials. Holdings from the antebellum and Civil War periods include some specialized collections, as well as microfilm of county records, newspapers, and censuses. The Archives website (www.wvculture.org/history) contains much information of interest to researchers, including guides to collections holdings, lists of West Virginia repositories and historical societies and of county history resources, and several searchable databases."

    "ABSTRACT":"As early as 1816, the Rocky Fork area is Godfrey, Illinois was one of the first Free State stops for slaves escaping Missouri. In the 1830's a more organized Underground Railroad route was established through the African Methodist Episcopal Church. The Rocky Fork area continued to serve as both a way stop and escapee community well after the Missouri Emancipation Proclamation of 1865. Since 1921 part of the Rocky Fork area has been used as a Boy Scout Camp however, physical evidence still exists of the escapees and their helpers. Various family stories, community memories and documents attest to the significance of the area. The primary boundaries of the Rocky Fork area include land in Sections 17, 20, 21, 28, 29, and 33 of Godfrey Township 6 North, Range 10 West. Satellite sites are reflected in Sections 4, 5, and 10."

    "ABSTRACT":"The John Gill Craven Home was a link in the Underground Railroad's large operation that was being conducted in Lancaster, Indiana. John Gill Craven was the son of Thomas Craven and helped his father start the Eleutherian Institute in 1848 that became Eleutherian College in 1854. John Gill Craven was the Principal and ran the College for several years. Since the school was an \"abolition school\", open to all regardless of color, and situated only a few miles from slave territory, it excited the bitter opposition of pro-slavery people, many of whom lived in that part of the state where the school was situated. John Gill Craven and James and Lucy Nelson were arrested by Wright Rae, the Sheriff of Jefferson County Indiana, under the 1850 Fugitive Slave Law. John and Martha Craven opened their home to black students and helped many freedom seekers to freedom. George DeBaptiste was living in the \"Georgetown District\" in Madison, Indiana, and brought many freedom seekers to Lancaster, Indiana, calling this area the \"New England Settlement\" where the underground railroad was always ready."

    "ABSTRACT":"In Their Steps, a self-guided walking tour of sites in Rockville, Maryland, associated with the Underground Railroad (UGRR), tells the story of Rockville's role as an active hub on a Southern route of the UGRR. As the county seat, Rockville is significant to the UGRR because of its geographical location, its mid-19th century demographic mix of free blacks and slaves, preservation of relevant sites, and the experiences of past residents who stood on various sides of enslavement issues. The tour begins at the 1891 Red Brick Courthouse, location of three previous county courthouses and jails, and the center of the slavery experience in Rockville. From there, the tour visits the homes of slaveholders who lost slaves to the UGRR, the stories of whom were chronicled by Philadelphia stationmaster William Still. Also included is the Robb's Tavern site, where Josiah Henson,escaped slave turned abolitionist,was first brought to Rockville. In addition to stories of The Pearl Affair, and the real Uncle Tom's Cabin told through local churches, burial grounds, museums and archives, our guides convey the story of lesser-known paths to freedom such as abduction, manumission, colonization, and escaped slaves who bought the freedom of family members."

Located in Calvert Co. on a 560-acre property along the Patuxent River and St. Leonard Creek, it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Battle of St. Leonard Creek, a large War of 1812 naval engagement, took place where the Patuxent River meets the mouth of St. Leonard Creek, right off the shore of JPPM.. Charles Ball, a Calvert Co. resident who wrote a narrative of his life in enslavement and his escape to freedom in the North, described fighting in this battle in his book, Slavery in the United States: A Narrative of the Life and Adventures of Charles Ball. A large portion of the property that is now JPPM was owned by George Peterson at the beginning of the Civil War. According to the 1850 census, Peterson enslaved 16 people. At least two of them, William Coates and William Jones, enlisted in the USCT and were freed."

    "ABSTRACT":"Mount Clare was built over 250 years ago on a hill overlooking the Patapsco River and Baltimore, MD, by Charles Carroll, Barrister. Today it is surrounded by the 30-acre Carroll Park; but it was once the hub of an agricultural plantation of 800 acres and one of the largest industrial complexes in America, the Baltimore Iron Works. Over 200 enslaved African Americans worked for Carroll at the Baltimore Iron Works or at the Mount Clare plantation. In the last half of the 18th century, there are at least 4 documented instances of freedom seekers escaping from these sites. MD's enslaved individuals had an uncommonly good setting for attempting escapes. For the Carroll's enslaved workforce an escape route via Baltimore was literally at their back door, only 5 miles distant. Baltimore's location, just over 40 miles from PA induced many freedom seekers to travel there in an effort to make their way to the free states. Many others stayed, finding employment in the businesses and industries in the city and shelter with Baltimore's large free African American community."

    "ABSTRACT":"Point Lookout State Park is the location of 4 significant sites related to the Underground Railroad Network to Freedom. The first site is the location of a Civil War Hospital, Hammond Hospital. Hammond's nurses and doctors assisted with the flight of several MD bondsmen who were not protected by the Emancipation Proclamation. Abolitionist Abigail Hopper Gibbons protected and smuggled several slaves to freedom from here. The second site is the location of the contraband camp just outside the prison. Here thousands of runaway African Americans from VA took refuge in MD under the protection of Federal authorities who were not required to return them to their masters across the Potomac River. The third site is the location of the Prisoner of War Camp for Confederates where units of the USCT served as guards during the war. The irony of African Americans guarding their former masters was not lost on the Confederate prisoners and caused much unrest in the prison. The fourth site is a viewshed of Point Lookout Creek, where on April 15, 1848, a ship named The Pearl carrying 77 freedom seekers stopped to wait out a storm and as a consequence, the runaways were caught."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Port Tobacco Courthouse, Charles County, MD, is verifiably associated with the UGRR, because there Mark Caesar (presumably free from Charles County) and Bill Wheeler (from Charles Co., master Benjamin Contee) were tried in 1845. Mark Caesar was considered an \"accomplice of slave flight.\" While some contemporary white accounts refer to an \"insurrection\" led by the two, it is possible that the African Americans involved considered it a break for freedom and were equipped with weapons for self-defense. Mark Caesar and Bill Wheeler left Charles Co. and were accompanied by more and more armed freedom seekers. The group reached the area of Rockville, MD, where 31 were captured and others continued to flee, some as far as Carroll Co., MD (which borders with PA). Although court records of the trial are missing, Maryland State Archives researchers found documentation of Mark Caesar in the MD Penitentiary Prisoners Record (1850), found a special law passed to ensure life imprisonment for Wheeler if he were not executed, and found numerous newspaper accounts of the 1845 escape, which frightened local whites by its daring. Previously, Mark Caesar did not enter official documentation -- not in the censuses for Anne Arundel Co., Baltimore Co., or Charles Co. (1830-50) nor among landowners listed for the 3 counties."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Dorchester County Courthouse, located in the port town of Cambridge, MD, was the site of several significant incidents in the story of the UGRR in Dorchester Co. In 1850, Kessiah Jolley Bowley and her 2 children escaped from the slave auction block in front of the courthouse. In 1857, free black preacher and UGRR agent Rev. Samauel Green was put on trial in the courthouse for providing a safe house for runaways, and for owning a copy of Uncle Tom's Cabin. Later in 1858, Hugh Hazlitt was tried and convicted here for assisting enslaved Africans in escaping in violation of the Fugitive Slave Act. During the trial, Hazlitt's case received national attention and was reported in the New York Tribune on Aug. 7, 1858. The Bowleys' escape is also of national significance, for it was the first time that Harriet Tubman, a nationally known conductor on the UGRR, helped others on their flight to freedom."

    "ABSTRACT":"Hampton National Historic Site, a premier example of Georgian architecture and landscape design, was once the center of a vast Maryland land holding that was a remarkable commercial, industrial and agricultural estate forged with indentured and enslaved labor. Hampton reflects a central irony in U.S. history €œ that a nation newly created on the principles of equality and freedom could accept the institution of slavery. National events and social change €œ the Revolution, establishment of a new economy, slavery, the Civil War, Emancipation, and Reconstruction €œ are reflected by the site's cultural resources, an unmatched and comprehensive assemblage of structures, landscapes, collections, and archives, preserved by one family over ten generations. This exceptional ensemble is an unusually complete chronicle that reveals the daily activities of the Ridgely family, laborers and slaves, and illustrates 18th and 19th century history and design. Documentation in the form of runaway slave advertisements, court records, correspondence, and family histories that people enslaved at Hampton tried, and in some cases succeeded, in following the Underground Railroad to freedom."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Jail plays a central role in the story of slavery and flight to freedom in St. Mary's County. It was common for runaways to be held in a public jail until their owner retrieved them or they were sold for cost of care. \"Some masters were accustomed to have committed ot the jail by magistrates such slaves as were unruly or desirous of running away, or whom, for one reason or another, they desired to have in safe keeping.\" (Brackett 82)At least 5 examples of runaway slaves being held in the jail can be found in the local newspaper, The St. Mary's Beacon. In St. Mary's Co. few accounts exist of the struggle to obtain freedom. The examples referenced in the Beacon give insight to recurring themes found throughout flight to freedom stories. In association with the jail whee these freedom seekers were held we see the flight for fear of being sold after a master's death, the influence of free blacks on enslaved, and the importance of travel by water."

    "ABSTRACT":"The harrowing solo journey of 16 year old, Caroline Quarlls, the first known \"passenger\" through the State of Wisconsin as told by Caroline Quarrels', own Great, Great, Great Granddaughter. This interpretive and educational program made personal by a descendant, is followed by audience discussion on American slavery. Caroline fled a St. Louis, Missouri plantation and life as the house servant to her paternal aunt, on July 4, 1842, amidst celebrations of \"our\" American freedom. Taking a ferry boat from St. Louis, and a stagecoach from Alton, Illinois, her seven hundred mile journey extended through Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, and Michigan. Caroline was helped by many abolitionists in the state of Wisconsin, and eventually escorted by Lyman Goodnow to freedom in Windsor, (Sandwich) Canada. Caroline's true story is fascinating to audiences as it includes people and characters that play a role in the history of the South, Midwest, and Ontario, Canada. Audiences who have benefited include school groups, several historical societies, and community groups in Wisconsin, Michigan and Windsor, Ontario. Lessons found in the flight of an American slave and the courageous people that helped her are perseverance, determination and strong belief that freedom, equality, and justice are a right for everyone."

    "ABSTRACT":"In 1843, Herman and Hannah Phillips walked with their four children from slavery in Maryland to Sherwood, New York. There, sponsored by Quaker storeowner Slocum Howland, they found work and a home. Recognized by a former Maryland neighbor who visited Sherwood in the late 1850s, the Phillips family fled to Canada. They soon returned to Sherwood, however, and in 1854, they bought land from Slocum Howland. They moved this house (built before 1837) to this spot about 1855, and here they raised their eight children. Three sons served in the Civil War. The house remained in the family until 1913, when Rose E. and Estella Phillips, daughter-in-law and granddaughter of Hannah and Herman, sold it to Isabel Howland, granddaughter of Slocum Howland. Estella Phillips remained in Sherwood, a friend, and employee of Isabel Howland, until Isabel's death in 1942, when Estella moved to Fitch Avenue in Auburn. Herman, Hannah, and several of their children are buried in the Sherwood cemetery, across the road from their house, Relatives of this family still remain in the area. Primary source documentation for this family is extensive through letters and diaries kept by Emily Howland, daughter of Slocum Howland."

    "ABSTRACT":"The building now known as 194 Livingston Avenue in the Arbor Hill section of Albany, Albany County, New York, is significant as the one-time office of the Vigilance Committee of Albany, the key Underground Railroad group in the City of Albany. It is one of many locations for this office but it is the only surviving site. The site is listed on the New York State and National Register of Historic Buildings. This committee was active from the early 1840s into the 1850s and assisted hundreds of fugitives from slavery to escape through Albany on their way to freedom in the northern United States and Canada. In addition, 194 Livingston is significant as the home of Stephen and Harriet Myers and their family. Stephen Myers was principal agent for the Vigilance Committee during the 1850s and one of the most significant figures in Albany's Underground Railroad history that had actively assisted escaped slaves for nearly 30 years, beginning in 1831. Myers lived in the house during the period when he was \"Superintendent\" for the Vigilance Committee and maintained the group's office in the building at the same time.\nThe site is now open from 12 pm to 8 pm, Monday through Friday, and weekends by appointment.  Please call 518-779-4038 before visiting to ensure staff is available."

    "ABSTRACT":"\"Experience the Underground Railroad\" is a partnership program between Cuyahoga Valley National Park (CVNP) and the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad (CVSR) that engages visitors in an interactive program in the role of escaping slaves. Throughout the program they meet first-person characters who provide a glimpse of the 1850s, hear a variety of opinions regarding slavery in Northeast Ohio, and experience the difficulties and dangers faced by escaping slaves. The program occurs the 1st and 2nd Saturday in November. Groups limited to 40 depart every 30 minutes on a 1.5-mile evening lantern hike around Indigo Lake and along the Ohio , Erie Towpath Trail. A total of 6 groups participate each night. The group boards the train for their return trip Currently, we do not have conclusive evidence that the Ohio , Erie Canal Towpath Trail was utilized by those escaping slavery on the Underground Railroad (UGRR). However, other similar areas have evidence so we assume that this experience may have occurred at CVNP. The program offers visitors many opportunities to make profound emotional connections to the meanings and significance of the UGRR and to understand why we interpret the UGRR at CVNP. It provides multiple perspectives throughout the program demonstrating the complexity of the issues associated with slavery in the 1850s."

A highly respected citizen of Zanesville, he was known for his giving nature and gentle demeanor. The house is one of the few homes of former slaves still standing in Muskingum County. There is strong oral tradition that Mr. Gant also did his part in freeing his brothers and sisters by riding them in his wagon, his known support and friendship with fellow Abolitionist. Noted local historian Norris Sneider in his \"Y-Bridge City\" in his Chapter on Slavery attested that there were about 622 people of color living in Muskingum County at the time and they all assisted in helping on the Underground Railroad. Mr. Gant was a member of a church that was founded on social issues and whose platform was the abolishment of slavery. His affiliations and association with known abolitionist support the oral tradition behind his involvement. This house is a beacon representing what you can achieve despite your humble beginnings. It has been recognized for its significance by Friends of Freedom Society, Ohio Department of Transportation, and National Road Alliance."

Those indicted for helping in the rescue were tried in Cleveland. John Price was led to freedom by several Oberlinians, and arrived in Canada."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Underground Railroad Tour \"On the Trail To Freedom\" is designed to show participants that Lorain County, Ohio, particularly the community of Oberlin, played a significant role in the abolitionist movement of the pre-Civil War era and included Stations 98, 99, and 100 on the Underground Railroad. Many freedom seekers passed through Lorain County in their search for the \"Promised Land\" in Canada until about 1861. Lorain County provided a direct route to Lake Erie, as the northern part of the county borders Lake Erie's central basin. However, rather than move on to Canada, many of these freedom seekers felt so safe in the little town of Oberlin that they decided to stay. They lived out their lives in peace among the safe confines of the town, some becoming anti-slavery activists and others being educated at Oberlin College. Because of the commitment of Oberlin's abolitionists, no freedom seekers were ever caught in the town and returned to bondage. This tour is the only program of its kind that celebrates Oberlin's proud heritage, with stops at all the major locations that represent the city's many contributions to abolitionism and the Underground Railroad."

It was thus acquired by the Northern VA Urban League for adaptive reuse. During the Civil War the former Slave Office was used to house contrabands, that is, those enslaved African Americans who fled their places of enslavement and flocked to Union protection from areas surrounding Washington, D.C., in order to obtain freedom. A number of primary sources document use of the property by contrabands -- a Union map, a minister's records of deaths and marriages among contrabands, and a diary and a letter written by women working to help refugees from slavery."

    "ABSTRACT":"Racine County's involvement in the Underground Railroad is documented from 1842 with Caroline Quarles' passage, through the Civil War with Racine's Colonel Utley and his Abolitionist Regiment. One major Racine UGRR conductor was Achas P. Dutton. He had a verified role in the escape of fugitive slave Joshua Glover and approximately a hundred others. His warehouses were concealment and embarkation sites, where Dutton could transfer fugitives to the vessels of abolition-friendly lake captains who then took them to Canadian ports and their freedom. Dutton provided a link to the Great Lakes maritime portion of the UGRR. His warehouses along the south bank of the Root River in Racine are long gone; the sites are now pleasure boat marinas and condo developments. We propose to commemorate his sites and the UGRR link to the Great Lakes with a monument on a city-owned promenade along the Root River, located within view of the original sites of Dutton's elevators and warehouses."

    "ABSTRACT":"The island is significant to the UGRR because Mason's Island, known now as Theodore Roosevelt Island, was originally called Analostan Island and is administered by the National Park Service. It is located at the fall line on the Potomac River. The river flows to either side of the island in two channels. Theodore Roosevelt Island is located within the District of Columbia. The island is part of the George Washington Memorial Parkway, a national parkway that extends almost 40 miles along the river, from Mt. Vernon to Great Falls Park. On New Years Day, 1863 President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation which not only freed slaves in rebellious states but also opened the door for formal enlistment of African-American troops in the army. The island was run on enslaved labor up through the Civil War, and is significant to the Underground Railroad because it was a site for contraband camps and, known as Camp Greene, a place for the United States Colored Troops to train. The government established \"contraband camps\" (for escaped bondsmen) becausethe influxcreated a demand for social services. The island was an encampment for the First USCT African-American Infantry in Washington, DC, between May-Sept 1863."

    "ABSTRACT":"Illinois College had close antislavery ties with the abolitionist and Underground Railroad movements from its inception. The College was founded in 1829 by local trustees and seven Yale graduates€all opposed to slavery. Its first president, Edward Beecher, and two College trustees helped organize the Illinois State Antislavery Society in 1837. Many of the early settlers in the region, however, had come from Border States and were pro-slavery. Despite this hostile environment, the College Staff and the majority of the students they influenced upheld strong antislavery principles. A few even acted to assist freedom seekers through the Underground Railroad. Some were arrested and all suffered threats and harassment. Professor Jonathan Baldwin Turner, a member of the Underground Railroad, helped guide three fleeing Negro women to safe haven from which they eventually reached freedom in Canada. Samuel Willard, an Illinois College student, was prosecuted and fined for attempting to free an escaping slave. Other students were the target of organized protests by pro-slavery advocates who were outraged by their participation in Underground Railroad activities. Early Illinois College, consisting of Beecher Hall and the former College Building, was clearly an academic center that motivated strong antislavery actions as well as beliefs."

    "ABSTRACT":"At the confluence of the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers in Prince George's County, Maryland, the Berry family cultivated crops on land purchased from the Addisons and the DeButts. Regardless of ownership, the back-breaking labor was done by enslaved workers. The Berry Farm (1308 acres) is gone, but the Berry fields still exist as part of Oxon Cove Park (234 acres) operated by the National Park Service. NPS was given responsibility for the area in 1967 and has operated a demonstration farm to educate the public. Wherever slavery exists, there will also be attempted flights to freedom. On the Berry farm, at least one person is known to have escaped. On December 5, 1840, Thomas Berry place an advertisement in the Daily National Intelligencer requesting information and/or the return of an enslaved person named Jacob Shaw. A second ad was placed by John Bayne (a neighboring farmer) seeking the return of Samuel Tyler, also an enslaved person who had fled at the same time as Shaw. Probably Shaw and Tyler fled together. Whether these men returned to slavery is not known. Given the location on the border of the District of Columbia, it was possible to escape and find shelter in the free black community of Washington, DC."

His autobiography has been called one of the ten most important slave narratives. In his narrative Pennington describes his early life on the Rockland estate and his escape from slavery in Maryland. Published in 1849, it went through three editions in eleven months, selling over 6000 copies. After his escape from his owner's Rockland estate in Washington Co., MD, at age 21, Pembroke changed his name to James William Charles Pennington, and, against all odds, became one of the most distinguished and respected nineteenth-century African American leaders. He became a minister in Presbyterian churches in New York and Hartford, was elected a delegate to several international abolition conventions, wrote one of the first histories of Africans in Americain 1841, lectured widely, led the struggle to desegregate New York City's public transit system, fought for the rights of blacks to vote, and remained active in the Underground Railroad. In 1849, the University of Heidelberg awarded Pennington a Doctor of Divinity in honor of his achievements."

    "ABSTRACT":"The nominated site was the home of Jacob and Hannah Leverton, Quakers. As agents of the Underground Railroad [UGRR], Jacob and Hannah Leverton sheltered freedom seekers. Near the division line between Caroline and Dorchester Counties, their first-quarter 19th century brick dwelling was located on several hundred contiguous acres of land. In 1898, William T. Kelley claimed that the Leverton home was \"the main stopping place for the UGRR in the area.\" Jacob Leverton helped a battered young girl escape her pursuers before they appeared at his farm, demanding an explanation for her disappearance. In January 1858, after exposure of their UGRR activities, Jacob's son, Arthur, and free-black neighbor, Daniel Hubbard, had to flee their homes to evade retaliation by an angry mob. Kelley and his Quaker father, Jonah, described by his son as \"a strong anti-slavery man,\" harbored unnumbered refugees on Jonah's land composed of several hundred acres west and south of Leverton. During the 1840s and 1850s, free-blacks bought small farms along the north side of the road between the two counties. In effect, this area near Preston was a haven of a thousand acres stretching nearly a mile along the bi-county road, largely owned by people who were sympathetic to the riddance of institutionalized slavery."

    "ABSTRACT":"HARRIET'S RETURN is an award winning theatrical production written and performed by playwright, actress, producer and educator Karen Jones Meadows. This unique production chronicles the private and public life of famed Underground Railroad conductor, spiritual icon and revolutionary, Harriet Tubman, whose nine-decade life still influences the consciousness of people around the world. Told as a deeply personal journey, Harriet embraces her audience and moves them to laughter, tears and a desire to realize their personal power. The play takes the audience from Harriet's childhood to her final days as she weaves her story, recalling more than thirty colorful characters who take you from contemporary America into the depths of her soul, the psyche of a nation and a call to action. Detailed American and Underground Railroad history is experienced as Harriet confronts enslavement, family issues, escape, marriages, the UGRR challenges, Civil War, Reconstruction and Jim Crow. She interacts with historical figures such as William Still and John Brown. Harriet's Return has a successful record, with productions in over 100 theatrical and community venues, including a fund-raising event at the Carrier Theatre, for the 30th Anniversity Pilgrimage Weekend to the historic landmark Harriet Tubman home. Harriet's Return crosses age and cultural classifications, and has universal appeal, as did Harriet Tubman. Frequently there are Q , A or scholarly discussions after performances. Sometimes performances are followed by an ancestral party/celebration, making Harriet's Return an extraordinary event."

In 1846, the Cayuga County Courthouse was also the site of the precedent-setting trial of African American Wiliam Freeman, charged with murder and defended by William Henry Seward on the basis of insanity. Finally, the Cayuga County Courthouse has a 1913 plaque dedicated to Harriet Tubman. This 1836 Greek Revival structure maintains superior architectural integrity and stands today as a vibrant example of living history as it continues its role as Cayuga County's Supreme and County Court."

CCHO provides two major services to its patrons: 1.) Genealogical Research and 2.)General Subject Research. This research is conducted through the use of the facility's microfiche collection, library holdings, and subject and family files organized y clear indices. Material generated by a 2004-2005 survey of sites related to the Underground Railroad, Abolitionism, and African American life within Cayuga County (sponsored by the city of Auburn Historical Resources Review Board and the Cayuga County Historian's Office, coordinated by Historical New York Research Associates, funded by Preserve New York) will be available at CCHO. This research merits recognition by the National Park Service for its value to a greater understanding of the UGRR movement in Central New York."

Well-documented cases of freedom seekers associated with Slocum Howland include Thomas and James Hart (1840) and the Hannah and Herman Phillips family (1843). A rare Underground Railroad pass survives, carried by Thomas and James Hart on their trip from Maryland. Other possible freedom seekers assisted by Slocum Howland include Jerome (Rome) Griger (Greger, Groger). and the Richard and Mary Gaskin family. Beginning in 1857, Slocum Howland's daughter, Emily Howland, worked in a school kept by Myrtilla Miner for African American girls in Washington, D.C.. During and after the Civil War, she worked in Freedmen's Schools in the South, and she and her father established and supported black schools in Virginia throughout the nineteenth century. "

    "ABSTRACT":"In 1838, James Canning Fuller was secretary of the new Skaneateles Anti-Slavery Society, which sent anti-slavery petitions to Congress and adopted a resolution calling for immediate emancipation. In 1839, Fuller seconded an anti-slavery resolution not, he said, \"as a member of the Societies Friends [Society of Friends] but as a MAN.\" In October of that year, the Colored American noted that he had been appointed by the New York State Anti-Slavery Society as a delegate to the World Anti-Slavery Convention to be held in London in 1840. In 1841, the Fullers hosted a family they had purchased from slavery. Also in 1841, James C. Fuller contributed $800 to purchase the Dawn Community near Chatham, Ontario, set up as a haven for freedom seekers, and he served on its first Board of Trustees. In 1843, Martha and David Wright sent a freedom seeker to the Fullers from Auburn. In 1851, after James C. Fuller's death, Lydia Fuller hosted Rev. Jermain Loguen when he fled Syracuse after the rescue of William \"Jerry\" Henry. When he returned to Syracuse in 1852, Loguen again stayed with Lydia Fuller."

Recent publications on the life of Harriet Tubman exist alongside primary resources on life in nineteenth-century Auburn, New York. The 2004-2005 survey conducted by the city of Auburn and Historical New York Research Associates has provided the facility with countless property listings and census records of individuals living in Auburn, New York who escaped slavery to find asylum in Central New York. These records become living history when interpreted alongside maps of the region and biographies of influential members of the Underground Railroad movement. Resources at the Mary Van Sickle Wait History Room are tactile means by which visitors can recreate the cultural atmosphere of the Underground Railroad Movement and understand its broader implications on nineteenth-century American life."

    "ABSTRACT":"HARRIET'S RETURN is an award winning theatrical production written and performed by playwright, actress, producer and educator Karen Jones Meadows. This unique production chronicles the private and public life of famed Underground Railroad conductor, spiritual icon and revolutionary, Harriet Tubman, whose nine-decade life still influences the consciousness of people around the world. Told as a deeply personal journey, Harriet embraces her audience and moves them to laughter, tears, and a desire to realize their personal power.\nThe play takes the audience from Harriet's childhood to her final days as she weaves her story , recalling more than thirty colorful characters who take you from contemporary America into the depths of her soul, the psyche of a nation, and a call to action. Detailed American and Underground Railroad history is experienced as Harriet confronts enslavement, family issues, escape, marriages, the UGRR challenges, Civil War, Reconstruction and Jim Crow. She interacts with historical figures such as William Still and John Brown.\nHarriet's Return has a successful record, with productions in over 100 theatrical and community venues including a fund raising event at The Carrier Theatre, for the 30th Anniversary Pilgrimage Weekend to The Historic Landmark Harriet Tubman Home.\nHarriet's Return crosses age and cultural classifications, and has universal appeal, as did Harriet Tubman. Frequently there are Q&A or scholarly discussions after performances. Sometimes performances are followed by an ancestral party/celebration, making Harriet's Return an extraordinary event."

    "ABSTRACT":"Mother Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church (Mother Bethel) was founded in Philadelphia in 1794 by Richard Allen. Allen had once been enslaved and understood the plight of those still held in bondage. Mother Bethel has been recognized as an abolitionist and an emancipationist church. Members were active with the Free African Society, a mutual aid society founded in 1787, known for assisting the enslaved on the UGRR. Members were also part of the local Vigilance Committee, Prince Hall Masons and Free Produce Association. The church was also the first to hold a national convention of Africans in 1830 and would later host many other abolitionist meetings and forums for many of the nation's great orators. Allen was a champion of the anti-slavery cause, and he became a spokesman for his people on both local and national issues. The bishops that followed in his footsteps would go on to establish churches and educational institutions within the United States, Europe, Africa, the Caribbean, and Canada."

    "ABSTRACT":"At Seventh , Water Streets, SW, in Washington, DC, there is now a Southwest Heritage Trail Marker.Itrepresents the site of departure of The Pearl as part of Cultural Tourism DC's efforts to document the city's history. In 1848 there occurred a large and celebrated attempted escape of bondsmenon a ship The Pearl, sailing down the Potomac River for Frenchtown, Maryland. The ship started from the steamship wharf. Over 70 freedom seekers were on board. The plan had been to dock at Frenchtown and travel north. Free and hired-out enslaved workers in DC planned the escape with the connivance and support of white abolitionists. Unfortunately, the attempt failed. Many freedom seekers involved were purchased by slave traders, like Hope Slatter of Baltimore and Bruin , Hill of Alexandria, for sale further south. A few lucky freedom seekers were redeemed and returned to DC, like the Edmonsons and Ellen Seward. The ship's two captains, Edward Sayres and Daniel Drayton, were convicted, fined, and sentenced to jail until receiving a post-Civil War pardon."

    "ABSTRACT":"Dr. Hiram Rutherford built his two story frame house off the square in Oakland in 1847. This building forms the core of the Oakland Landmarks, Inc. historic compound. Dr. Rutherford, Gideon Ashmore a local hotel tavern owner, General Robert Matson a slave owner from Kentucky with a farm north of Oakland, and Abraham Lincoln became involved in the Matson Slave Trial in 1847. Each spring Matson would bring some of his slaves to Illinois to work his Illinois farm and then take them back to Kentucky in the fall after the crops were harvested. One family fearing the wife and children would be sold when they returned to Kentucky fled and sought shelter with well known abolitionists Rutherford and Ashmore. Matson filed a suit against Rutherford and Ashmore in the circuit court under the Black Law, demanding damages in the sum of twenty-five hundred dollars, or five hundred dollars for each slave. This trial became known as the Matson Slave Trial and has been called one of the top 5 Legal Cases in Coles County between 1830-1900. The case was heard in Circuit Court in Charleston in October. The case hinged on the concept that if the slaves were only crossing the state (in transit) they would not be free but if they were located for a time by the consent of the master they would be free. Rutherford and Ashmore won, the slaves were freed, and Matson left town without paying his bills (which included Lincoln's fee)."

When the family reached Decatur County, Woodson Clark captured the family and confined them until he could arrange transportation south. The African American community enlisted the help of Luther Donnell, who worked to obtain a writ of habeas corpus to take possession of the family. Eventually the family was located and assisted via the Underground Railroad, by both the African American and White community, to Canada. Donnell was arrested under Indiana law and indicted for \"aiding Negroes to escape.\" The jury found him guilty. Then Ray brought suite in the US court for the recovery of the value of his slaves. He obtained a judgment of $3000 ($1500 for the value of the individuals plus court costs). In 1852, the Indiana Supreme Court overturned the criminal case verdict based on judicial error, that the Indiana law under which Donnell was prosecuted was unconstitutional."

MCHS government and family records include materials that are invaluable for understanding the history of the Underground Railroad (UGRR) in Montgomery Co. and MD, and they also serve as important sources for state and local African-American history. County antebellum tax lists, probate records, and census records reveal much about the patterns of slaveholding in Montgomery Co. and establish social and cultural context for UGRR. The MCHS collection of county newspapers record fugitive slave notices, sales of bondsmen, and other related information. Local African-American authors and genealogists have provided books, manuscripts, and oral histories which enhance the collections. MCHS has used these sources to create a teaching unit on UGRR for 5th and 6th graders. The library is open to the public and research assistance is avaialable through www.montgomeryhistory.org. The print collections are indexed and available through the public library's online catalogue."

    "ABSTRACT":"Finding A Way To Freedom: The Underground Railroad in Dorchester and Caroline Counties in the 1850s, is a 105 mile self-guided driving tour, which takes visitors on a journey through nationally significant stories and landscapes associated with the life of the great Underground Railroad conductor, Harriet Tubman, and places associated with the Underground movement in Dorchester and Caroline counties on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. Finding a Way to Freedom guides people to exhibits, homes and home sites, meeting houses, mills, courthouses, roads, churches, wharves, waterways, fields, forests, and other significant landscapes that relate to and illustrate the real life stories of the region's own specific Underground Railroad, including the people who used it, operated it, and the those who sought to destroy it in the decade leading up to the Civil War. The tour guides visitors through a variety of natural environments that were both barriers and pathways to freedom. Through well documented stories and sites, the Finding A Way to Freedom tour helps visitors learn about the URR, Harriet Tubman, resistance to slavery, and African American history in the region, and discover how ordinary people in a southern slaveholding community faced extraordinary challenges to help others secure their freedom"

    "ABSTRACT":"After the successful October 1851 rescue of freedom seeker William Henry in Syracuse, New York rescue leader, black abolitionist and former freedom seeker, Jermaine Loguen, took refuge in the M'Clintock house in Waterloo, NY. The M'Clintock family of radical Hicksite Quakers lived in the house from 1836-1856. During that time they helped organize the Western New York Anti-Slavery Society, held anti-slavery fairs, led anti-slavery petition drives and sold goods \"free from the labor of slaves.\" They often entertained abolitionist leaders including William Lloyd Garrison, Frederick Douglass, Lucretia Mott and Abby Kelley Foster. Thomas and Mary Ann M'Clintock married in 1820 and lived in Philadelphia. They were key supporters of the Hicksite split from Orthodox Quakerism in 1827, and the formation of the American Anti-Slavery Society and the Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society in 1833. Thomas was a founder of the Free Produce Society. An eyewitness places Jermain Loguen in the M'Clintock home one night in 1851 where, armed, he nervously paced back and forth ready to protect his freedom as he made his way to Canada. M'Clintock house, is now part of Women's Rights National Historical Park."

    "ABSTRACT":"In 1844 before a new church was considered, future members of this new church were already at work helping fugitive slaves escape to freedom. These members wanted to have their church on record as being an anti-slavery church. They prepared a petition for this proposal and the petition was tabled. A committee was formed and meetings were held to discuss forming a new church. On Jan 2, 1846, forty-one people asked for letters of dismissal and on Jan 3, 1846 the first meeting of the new church took place. Members sheltered fugitive slaves, provided food and finances, and took legal action against slavery. This church was originally named the First Independent Congregational Church of Elmira. In 1871 on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the church, it was renamed the Park Church."

    "ABSTRACT":"Thomas James was born in slavery, migrated to Canada, and then returned to settle in Seneca Falls, New York, where he became a barber and wealthy landowner. In the 1850 federal census, he listed his birthplace as \"unknown,\" with a 13-year-old daughter born in Canada. In 1863, two newspaper articles noted that he was a \"fugitive slave\" who owned $12-15 thousand dollars of real estate in Seneca Falls, including a new brick business block. \"He has shown that although he belongs to the down-trodden race \"he can take care of himself\", and we think no one will deny that he has \"rights which white men are bound to respect,\" Judge Taney to the contrary notwithstanding.\" At his death in 1867, executors of his will noted that \"\"Elizabeth James, his widow, and the said Thomas James had no other relatives known to the deponents or either of them, he having formerly been a slave and made, during his lifetime, diligent enquiry for his relatives without effect.\" As a barber, Thomas James cut the hair of Elizabeth Cady Stanton in 1852, as part of Stanton's campaign for health reform."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Fair Hill Burial Ground is the final resting place of many individuals who were involved in the Underground Railroad. Robert Purvis, who organized the Vigilant Association in 1837, is credited by some historians as helping 3000 freedom seekers through the Philadelphia area. Among the most famous he assisted was Harriet Jacobs, whose story of being confined to her grandmother's attic is often told. Harriet Forten Purvis, his wife, was a member of the Philadelphia Female Society which raised money for the Vigilant Association, later the Vigilant Committee. Lucretia and James Mott supported the underground railroad, and frequently hid Freedom Seekers. Edward M. Davis supported the underground railroad, and lent his farm to the U. S. Army for the training of the first black regiments during the Civil War. Edward Hopper, son of Isaac Hopper, an underground railroad pioneer, was a lawyer who defended many Freedom Seekers including Daniel Dangerfield. Nine members of the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society and the American Anti-Slavery Society, and 104 members of the Pennsylvania Abolition Society are buried at Fair Hill."

    "ABSTRACT":"U.S. Congressman Thaddeus Stevens (1792-1868) was a pivotal figure in the public affairs of Pennsylvania and the nation from the 1820s through 1868, when he died in Washington D.C. He championed free public education in the early-mid 1830s. During two terms in the U.S. Congress, he was a member of the Whig Party (1849-53) and help found the Republican Party (1859-1868). An avowed Abolitionist and Constitutional scholar, Stevens played key roles in the passage of the 13th and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. He also laid the groundwork for the 15th Amendment, enacted after his death. The \"old Commoner\" was one of the prime movers of Reconstruction and was the leading advocate for the Impeachment of President Andrew Johnson. Stevens was an Underground Railroad activist during his residency in Lancaster, PA (1842-1868). Appropriately, the south face of Stevens's memorial in Lancaster is inscribed with the epitaph: \"I repose in this quiet and secluded spot, not for any natural preference for solitude. But finding other cemeteries limited as to race by charter rules, I have chosen this that I might illustrate in my death, the principles which I advocated through a long life. Equality of man before his creator.\""

    "ABSTRACT":"Joshua Glover, a runaway slave from St. Louis, Missouri, escaped from his owner Benammi S. Garland in the spring of 1852. He made his way to Racine, where he worked at a sawmill for almost two years. On March 10, 1854, his owner, accompanied by a federal marshal and others, broke into his cabin, struck him on the head, manacled him and took him to a jail in Milwaukee. When word reached the citizens of Racine, the courthouse bell was rung, and the largest group ever to gather in the city assembled at Haymarket Square (now Monument Square, and an NTF site). Warrants were issued for the arrest of Glover's owner and the U. S. marshal. A committee of 100 men with strong abolitionist sentiments accompanied the Racine sheriff to Milwaukee to bring the kidnappers back to Racine to face charges. Upon their arrival at the Milwaukee jail, they encountered a crowd of protesters estimated to number between 3000 and 5000, demanding Glover's release. Shortly thereafter, a number of those assembled picked up a timber from a nearby construction site. Using it as a battering ram, they freed Glover from jail, whence he was shuttled on a several weeks journey on the Underground Railroad though three additional counties of southeastern Wisconsin, finally being placed aboard a ship in Racine (at Dutton's warehouse, another NTF site), eventually landing in Canada where he spent the next 34 years in freedom, until his death in 1888."

He was shuttled on the underground railroad throughout southeastern Wisconsin and finally escaped through Racine harbor on a ship for Canada. Today in Racine, the Glover story has been celebrated.

    "ABSTRACT":"The program, \"Mattie, Johnny and Smooth White Stones: Part II\", is the continuation of a story about a slave couple who escaped on the Underground Railroad. This 35 minutes film provides a first person narrative of a freedom seeker, Mattie, who tells her story after succesfully journeying from Georgia to Ohio. Though dozens of slaves made it across the Mason Dixon line to freedom, many of their slave owners would petition for their return or send slave catchers to retrieve them because of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. Thus, this story allows the viewer to see what life was like after the long journey to freedom for some of the runaways. Part II was shot on location in Ripley, OH where noted abolitionists John Rankin and John Parker and others helped dozens of runaway slaves. These men and their antislavery activities are featured in the film."

    "ABSTRACT":"Much historical evidence documents the importance to the Underground Railroad in the Upper Midwest of the Abolitionist colony that in 1837 established the town of Galesburg and Knox College. The Galesburg Colony Underground Railroad Freedom Station at Knox College maintains a commemorative center and educational programs, in the form of tours and public presentations, which educate the public about that important history in accessible, historically accurate ways. Since 2001, the Station's director, Owen W. Muelder, has made more than 60 public presentations on the history of the UGRR in Western Illinois, included the Illinois State Historical Society. Snice 2004, the Stateion has maintained a commemorative center in the Old Knox County Jail, on the Knox College campus, with displays, a website, and an active program of tours and presentations. The work of the Station and its director is helping both to document the important local sites (which we hope to submit for NTF recognition in the future) and broaden public awareness of these sites and of the larger local, regional, and national history of which they are a part."

    "ABSTRACT":"A primary purpose of researching the Underground Railroad in Illinois and adjacent states, has been to address the dearth of verified knowledge about UGRR operations west of the Ohio River. Key findings of this research have been that most freedom seekers coming through Illinois had been enslaved in Missouri and that Chicago was the terminus of most Illinois routes. The incorporation of these findings into an illustrated narrative program is used to disseminate knowledge of this important aspect of our history. As a conservative estimate over 600 programs have bee presented (approximately 400 at schools, 57 for the Illinois Humanities Council's \"Roads Scholars\" speakers bureau, a comparable number at historical and genealogical societies, at least 80 at libraries, 35 at museums, and at such annual meetings as the Illinois Reading Council, Illinois State historical Society, Illinois Gifter Conference, the History and Geneology Conference at teh Buxton National Historic Site and Museum and the Illinois Council for the Social Studies Conference to be held in Sept 2007). Audiences have ranged from approximately 20 to 700. The presentations were first given locally on an infrequent basis in the 1970s then more frequently and over a larger geographical area after the presenter retired from public school teaching in 1988."

    "ABSTRACT":"On April14, 1860 Alexander McClure, an enslaved man from Nashville, Tennessee, arranged for friends to place him in a box and ship him to a \"Hannah M. Johnson\" care of Levi Coffin, a prominent Underground Railroad activist living in Cincinnati, Ohio. At the train station in Seymour, Indiana (Jackson County) Alexander's was broken while being transferred to the southeast bound train and he was revealed, ending his journey to freedom. Alexander was arrested and extradited to Tennessee. Alexander implicated three persons who helped him in his attempted escape, a free black man, an enslaved black man, and a white man.\n\n\n\nNathan James, a free black in Nashville, was arrested and found to be an escaped slave himself.\n\nIt is unclear what happened to James, but it appears he might have been sold into slavery.\n\nAlfred Savage, the slave who allegedly introduced the Alexander to the third conspirator, a white man, was given 15 lashes for his part. It is unclear what ever became of Savage.\n\nThe white man's identity was never revealed, as all of the others involved claimed not to know his name.\n\nLevi Coffin was questioned about his role in the escape, but he denied any knowledge.\n\nHannah M. Johnson, the woman to whom Alexander had tried to ship himself, was never found.\n\nAfter his failed escape, it seems Alexander remained in Tennessee as he can be found living and working in Nashville after the Civil War.\n\n"

    "ABSTRACT":"William and Margaret Hicklin acquired 320 acres in Jennings County Indiana on Little Graham Creek in 1819. Their sons Thomas Hicklin, Lewis Hicklin, John L. Hicklin and James Hicklin lived on this land and operated an outstanding Underground Railroad Station. Lewis and Thomas Hicklin became ministers and John and Martha Hicklin were members of Graham Baptist Church and in 1842 donated two acres of land for the church. James Hicklin was dismissed, from this church for \"breaking the law and aiding to convey slaves from their masters\". Lewis Hicklin was an agent for the Anti-Slavery Society and started Neil's Creek Anti-Slavery Society of Lancaster, Indiana, and many others. The Hicklin Station was located just ten miles north of Eleutherian College in Lancaster, Indiana. There are documented stories in William Seibert Papers about the Hicklin Station and their work in moving freedom seekers north to freedom. Wright Rea, the slave catcher of Madison, Indiana, watched the Hicklin Station very closely to try to catch this family in their successful activities, but was never successful in that effort. William, wife Margaret and son Thomas Hicklin are buried at Home site, the rest of the family moved to Oregon in 1849."

Various family members were actively involved in or were firsthand witnesses to the Revolutionary, Barbary and Civil Wars; nineteenth century American art, theater and literary culture, and politics; world travel; and social movements such as abolition, women's education, historic preservation and socialism. In addition, the collection illuminates the daily lives of the house's occupants with great immediacy; outlines the history and use of objects (now in the museum collections) acquired by the Longfellow family and documents changes to the structures and grounds. Longfellow NHS is associated with the Underground Railroad through Henry W. Longfellow's financial contributions to freedom seekers, purchase of freedom seekers and court cases involving freedom seekers."

    "ABSTRACT":"Mt Auburn Cemetery is the final resting place of abolitionists and figures associated with the UGRR. Freedom seekers Harriet Jacobs and John Jacobs each published a narrative about their escape from enslavement in order to gain support for the abolitionist movement. The monument of Peter Byus tells the story of another freedom seeker. Charles Torrey aided the escape of runaways through Baltimore on their journey to freedom. Caterer Joshua Bowen Smith employed freedom seekers and kept them safely hidden from bounty hunters passing through Boston. Abolitionist George Luther Stearns often hid runaways at his Medford, MA farm. Stearns and abolitionist Samuel Gridely Howe were two members of the \"Secret Six,\" a group of men who secretly financed the activities of abolitionist John Brown prior to Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry. Senator Charles Sumner began his political career as an outspoken defender of the abolitionist movement and sparked political controversy with his speeches against the Fugitive Slave Act. Amos Adams Lawrence helped to support the anti-slavery movement by providing funds to settle Kansas as a free territory. Notable authors James Russell Lowell, Maria Lowell, Julia Ward Howe, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and John Pierpont supported the anti-slavery movement through their writings."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Banneker-Douglass Museum preserves, documents, and exhibits the historical and cultural experiences of African Americans in Maryland. It is named in recognition of two key African-American figures in Maryland history: Benjamin Banneker (1731-1806) and Frederick Douglass (1818-1895). Frederick Douglass was a significant leader in the Underground Railroad. He escaped from slavery and became a leading abolitionist and orator of his time. In addition to offering interpretive program information about Frederick Douglass, the Museum's permanent exhibit entitled \"Deep Roots, Rising Waters: A History of African Americans in Maryland\" includes special coverage of two other prominent Marylanders involved in the Underground Railroad: James W.C. Pennington and Harriet Tubman. The Museum is administered by the Maryland Commission on African American History and Culture. A major goal of both the Museum and the Commission is to encourage an understanding and appreciation of African-American history and culture through research, publications, programming, and public education for the benefit of Maryland students, the general public, and future generations. The Museum is Maryland's official repository of African-American material culture."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Maryland State House has significant relevance to the Underground Railroad in five areas that involve all three branches of government as well as two conventions, one seeking to defend slavery, the other abolishing it. The Maryland legislature debated and enacted laws relating to runaway slaves, punishment for assisting runaways, and the rights of slaveowners to recover escaped slaves. The State's governors, from their State House office, issued pardons for individuals convicted of crimes for their Underground Railroad activities and issued requisitions for the return of men charged in Maryland with assisting runaways who were being held in other jurisdictions. The Court of Appeals, which met in the State House, heard on appeal from circuit courts cases relating to the Underground Railroad. In January 1842, a \"Slaveholders' Convention\" met in the House of Delegates chamber and drew up a list of twenty-five propositions for consideration by the legislature; a bill incorporating the Convention's proposals subsequently passed the House of Delegates but was rejected by the Senate. Finally, the Consitutional Convention that met in 1864, by abolishing slavery in Maryland, brought the activities of the Underground Railroad to an end."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Things Hold, Lines Connect permanent gallery at the Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African American History , Culture presents a program that features 200 years of Maryland slavery. A special emphasis is placed on the people and events related to Maryland's Underground Railroad. Its themes of survival against all odds; self-determination to reinforce commitment to one another; the importance of family bonds; and the formation and ties of communities through worship are conveyed with a provocative interplay of oral histories, imagery, music and sounds. The program's title is derived from a quote by poet Lucille Clifton in her 1976 poem entitled \"Generations\" -- \"Things don't fall apart. Things hold. Lines connect in ways that last and last and lives become generations made out of pictures and words just kept.\" The emotionally charged program shows the poignant difference between those blacks who were free and those who were not. Runaways and other heroes of Maryland's Underground Railroad from throughout the state are featured in the program gallery. They include Josiah Henson, Samuel Denson, Charles Ball, William Parker, Ann Marie Weems, Thomas Smallwood, James Pennington, Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman."

    "ABSTRACT":"This 1816 Farmington Quaker meetinghouse represents the importance of Farmington, New York, just east of Rochester, as a key node in the national Underground Railroad network. Underground Railroad people associated with this meetinghouse included freedom seeker Austin Steward, who lived with the Otis Comstock family from 1814-1818 and quite likely helped build this meetinghouse; Darius Comstock, President of the Ontario Manumission Society; Quaker minister Lucretia Mott; and Pliny Sexton, Griffith M. Cooper, and Elias and Susan Doty, members of this meeting who kept UGRR safe houses. In 1836, Farmington Monthly Meeting (Orthodox) published an abolitionist statement. Other UGRR people associated either with this meetinghouse or with the Orthodox meetinghouse across the road (no longer standing) included members of the Smith, Hathaway, and Wilbur families and freedom seekers Richard Valentine, Frederick Douglass, William Wells Brown, Charles Remond, and Mary and Emily Edmondson. Quakers in Farmington were linked to a major UGRR network connected to William Chaplin and to Myrtilla Miner's school in Washington, D.C. In October 1848, the reform-minded Congregational Friends organized here, with Elizabeth Cady Stanton as a speaker."

    "ABSTRACT":"Information obtained from close family members maintain that the Hunt House was used as a refuge for freedom seekers on the Underground Railroad. The Hunts offered their home as \"a comfortable lodging place to many a colored person and to groups of them who were being helped under cover of darkness to freedom a few miles to the north.\" The Hunt House, built by Richard P. Hunt in 1829, is most famous as the gathering place of five women, who, in 1848, created the call to the first women's rights convention. However, there is more history to the house and its earliest inhabitants, for many individuals that were devoted to the women's rights movement were also committed to the antislavery movement. With Sarah M'Clintock and Jane Master Hunt, Richard P. Hunt's third and fourth wives, strong familial, spiritual, and social bonds were created with Quaker abolitionist families, the M'Clintocks and the Truman-Underhills. The M'Clintocks, the Hunts, and the Truman-Underhill families were all active in various antislavery and social betterment activities. These families helped to form various antislavery societies, created and/or signed numerous antislavery petitions, and helped to plan or attended antislavery conventions."

    "ABSTRACT":"Home of Quakers Slocum and Hannah Howland, this house was one of the most active Underground Railroad way stations in central New York, receiving freedom seekers from the Fussells in southeastern Pennsylvania. Howland was economically prosperous, owning a general store, port facilities on Cayuga Lake, and tenant houses. He helped freedom seekers escape to Canada and also helped at least four African American families settle locally. He sold land in Sherwood to Herman and Hannah Phillips and their four children, who came from Maryland in 1843. Thomas Hart (who carried a written pass, still extant, to Howland in 1840) settled nearby in Aurora. Jerome Grieger (who reported his birthplace variously as South Carolina, Spain, and unknown) worked for Howland at his docks on Cayuga Lake. And Richard and Mary Gaskin lived on a local farm. Richard Gaskin later joined the North Street Quaker meeting with the Howlands. Howland worked closely with William Lloyd Garrison and the American Anti-Slavery Society. His only daughter, Emily Howland, taught at Mytilla Miner's school for African Americans in Washington, D.C., and, with Slocum's help, established schools in Virginia for freed people of color."

    "ABSTRACT":"Thomas Elliott and Ann Marie Stewart Elliott, married in 1864, represent two important Underground Railroad families and stories. Ann Marie Stewart was likely a niece of Harriet Tubman. Thomas Elliott was born into slavery in Dorchester County, Maryland. In 1857, Elliott escaped with seven others using instructions given to them by Harriet Tubman. With a price of $3000.00 on their heads, they were betrayed into the hands of the sheriff of Dover, Delaware. They escaped by throwing hot coals into the sheriff's own apartment, jumping out of a twelve-foot high window and leaping over a wall. They made their way to Thomas Garrett in Wilmington, Del., who sent them to William Still in Philadelphia. This dramatic escape story earned them the nickname of the \"Dover Eight.\" Elliott later joined John Brown in St. Catharine's, Ontario, but did not go to Harper's Ferry. This house, built in 1868, is also important as a likely example of an African American vernacular architecture form, based conceptually on twelve-foot measurements rather than the 16-18 foot widths more common to Anglo-American vernacular buildings."

    "ABSTRACT":"Constructed between March and December 1834, the North Street Meetinghouse was, said Emily Howland, one of the Orthodox Friends who attended it wrote, \"a storm center for reformers.\" African American members included Gidean Wainwright, nephew of Paul Cuffee, who joined before this building was constructed, and probably Richard Gaskin, born in Virginia, who arrived in 1864. European American abolitionist members of this meeting included the Slocum and Hannah Howland family, David and Edna Thomas, Isaac and Susan Jacobs, Susannah Marriott, and Joseph and Sarah Tallcott. In November 1837, the Cayuga County Anti-Slavery Society held one of its first meetings here (having been refused space in the Presbyterian Church in Aurora). \"The meeting was well attended principally by the Friends who are numerous in this quarter and quite generally abolitionists,\" reported the Friend of Man, newspaper of the New York State Anti-Slavery Society. In 1843, Garrisonian abolitionist Abby Kelley spoke here, as part of her tour of New York State. In 1850, the meeting helped raise bail money for William Chaplin, jailed in Maryland for attempting to rescue people from slavery. The meeting also raised money to give Chaplin an inscribed silver pitcher. During the Civil War, a women's sewing circle made clothes for freed people. Harriet Hunt, one of the earliest woman physicians in the U.S. gave a lecture here."

    "ABSTRACT":"Belmont Mansion was the 18th and 19th century home of Judge Richard Peters and family. In 1787, Judge Peters was one of the first non-Quakers to join the Pennsylvania Society for the Abolition of Slavery (PAS). This society was organized in 1775 with two strategies: Petitioning and Legal Work. From the 1780's they ran the most important legal aid system for endangered African American by \"lawyerly\" chipping away at slavery's margins. A major concern for PAS was the kidnapping of free blacks the \"reverse underground railroad\". PAS was also on the side of freedom whether the person threatened was free or a fugitive. The \"Columbia and Philadelphia\" Railroad was built across Belmont in 1829. The western end of the \"Columbia and Philadelphia\" Railroad Bridge across the Schuylkill River was set on the banks of the Belmont property and an inclined plane ran diagonally from the bridge to just north of Belmont. This same railroad was used by William Whipper, UGRR agent and lumber merchant of Columbia, PA. Freedom Seekers were often hid in the false end of a boxcar when leaving Columbia and an UGRR agent received them when they got off at the head of the inclined plane at Belmont."

The Society's mission is to collect, preserve, interpret and promote research of Cumberland County history, and has been serving the area since its founding in 1874. The County Commissioners designated the society as the official repository for the county's historical records dating from the 1750s. The Library and Photo Archives contain many sources relating to the UGRR: books, drop files, photographs, newspaper articles, census records, cemetery records, tax records, pamphlets and special collections, including the Johnson Collection of artifacts and papers relating to the entire history of a Cumberland County African American family from the 1700s to the present. The new Museum encompasses 6,500 square feet and contains 16 galleries, eight changing windows to history and includes two large changing galleries. As part of the Military Exhibit there is a map of Cumberland County highlighting sites associated with the UGRR. The display includes photographs, reward posters, a flyer from Philadelphia to raise funds for Daniel Kaufman's court costs and newspaper articles about agent Daniel Kaufman. The display also includes information about the 1847 McClintock Riot over runaways."

    "ABSTRACT":"Menallen Friends Meeting (Quakers) is the burial site of Adams County anti-slavery activist and Underground Railroad stationmaster Cyrus Griest (1803-1869). Griest, along with many of his family members buried at Menallen Meeting, were key supporters for freedom seekers passing through Adams County, Pennsylvania, along what has come to be called either the Central Route or the Southeastern Corridor of the Underground Railroad. Menallen Meeting was established in 1780 and worship began at the present site in about 1838. Griest's involvement in the Underground Railroad is established by his collaborative activity with other Quakers and formerly enslaved African Americans who, by the mid-19th century, owned property in the community. This Adams County group is estimated to have been responsible for secreting hundreds - perhaps as many as 1000 freedom seekers. Griest is also recorded as having worked to restore freedom to Kitty Payne, a manumitted slave and the mother of three, who lived in Adams County and who was kidnapped back to the South by agents of her former Virginia owners. Griest, along with fellow Quakers and African American neighbors, gave testimony at the trial in Pennsylvania of her kidnapper in 1845. Griest was involved in raising money among Adams Countians for her trial in Virginia."

    "ABSTRACT":"Yellow Hill was the site of an African American community, including dwellings, a church and cemetery that by the mid-19th century became part of a network of sites providing safe haven for freedom seekers following two of Pennsylvania's major routes of the Underground Railroad. Edward Mathews (1807-1874), a native of Maryland, acquired 16 acres here in 1842 and became a farmer. At Yellow Hill, Mathews collaborated with other free African Americans and their white neighbors €œ mainly members of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) €œ in assisting hundreds €œ collectively perhaps up to 1000 €œ freedom seekers. In addition to activities as an Underground Railroad stationmaster, Mathews was a community benefactor. He bequeathed land adjacent to his homestead for the community church and burial ground. The Yellow Hill African Methodist Episcopal (AKA Union) Church was destroyed in a suspicious fire sometime in the late 19th century. Veterans of the U.S. Colored Troops were buried at this site. Today, this unassuming parcel of ground remains as the last remnant of the community of Yellow Hill where this chapter in the story of the Underground Railroad can be interpreted."

    "ABSTRACT":"\"Living The Experience\" (LTE) is an Interactive Spiritual Underground Railroad reenactment, which educates national audiences about the Underground Railroad efforts in Lancaster County. This living history program uses the art of first person interpretation and interaction to teach its audience about conductors, abolitionists, and safe houses that operated during the Underground Railroad. The production actively engages its audience members from the start. Our visitors are described as runaways, who have found Bethel AME church as their safe haven and shelter. As the show progresses, the audience members are used to assist in the interpretation of the stories, such as, the African Methodist denomination and it's position and assistance in the abolishment of slavery, the Christiana Resistance (1850 Fugitive Slave Law Act), Rev. Stephen Smith, and Thaddeus Stevens. LTE demonstrates the enslaved African's faith and ingenuity through the use of Negro Spirituals that were used during the UGGR. Following the production is a buffet style meal indicative of the 1800s. A session is included during the meal, during which time, the encoded messages hidden in the Spirituals are taught and discussed. Additional UGRR information and interaction is shared during shows with school-aged children."

Huntington Meetinghouse also contains the remains of other members of the Religious Society of Friends who were active in what has come to be called either Pennsylvania's Southeast Corridor or Central Route of the Underground Railroad, both of which originated in Adams County. In 1750 the original meetinghouse and burial ground was established; however, the meetinghouse was replaced in 1790 by the stone structure that is extant today. This is the only known location to appropriately commemorate the lives of the Wrights. The Wrights assisted approximately one thousand freedom seekers during the period 1819 to about 1860, including Dr. James William Charles (J.W.C.) Pennington, also known as Jim Pembroke. Pennington credits the Wrights with helping him to read and write during his six-month refuge, assistance that enabled him to become a Presbyterian Pastor and author of several books, most notably his narrative of escape from slavery in Maryland entitled The Fugitive Blacksmith (1849)."

Leesylvania, which means \"Lee's Woods,\" was the circa 1750 home of Henry Lee II and birthplace of Henry Lee III, Revolutionary War hero and father of General Robert E. Lee. Nineteenth century owners were: Charles Lee; Martha Lindsay Fairfax Robertson; and Lt. Col. John Walter Fairfax. A significant part of all of the owners' farms was the fishery at Freestone Point retained in the present park. Cate and Sinah, the 18th century runaways, were advertised in Virginia Journal and Alexandria Advertiser, Oct. 21, 1784, Leesylvania. The 19th century runaways listed in Alexandria Gazette are: Andrew and James, June 12, 1807, Leesylvania Farm; Daniel, Feb. 25, 1848, Freestone Farm; Henry and Betsy, June 26, 1856, Ohio Farm; and (Henry, Betsy), Tom, Armstead, Littleton, Abram, and Moses, Ohio Farm, August 15, 1856.\n\nThe Confederate Battery is significant because five African Americans (four men and one woman) escaped to the US Steam Sloop Seminole on Sept. 23, 1861, reporting Confederate troop numbers and the Freestone Point Confederate Battery location."

    "ABSTRACT":"The African American Civil War Memorial in Washington, DC, transferred to the NPS in November 2004, is the nation's only monument to all the United States Colored Troops (USCT). The names of more than 209,000 white officers and black soldiers are inscribed on the Wall of Honor beside the \"Spirit of Freedom\" sculpture by Ed Hamilton. This Memorial is significant to \"resistance to enslavement through flight\" because many members of the over 200,000 USCT joined up directly from enslavement. Horton estimates half of those serving in the USCT. The Memorial is a tribute to the bravery of these troops. McPherson estimates 37,300 died. 17 soldiers and 4 sailors received Congressional Medals of Honor. Runaways became automatically free upon joining the army, but they also fought for the freedom of their families and all enslaved African Americans. Because of the list of USCT on the wall, compiled from National Archives records, this memorial is the only place to commemorate all the soldiers who were refugees from slavery."

During its 80-year span as an active plantation (1785-1865), five generatons of native African and American-born enslaved people commingled to form one extensive web of kinship. Within each generation parents or their progeny acted out the inherent universal human yearning for freedom, often only to have their quest thwarted by their enslaver's fixed belief in human bondage."

    "ABSTRACT":"Before the Civil War, Blairsville was a transportation terminus connecting east to west over the Appalachian Mountains via canal and railroads. Blairsville had one of the larger black communities in Indiana county and the first AME Zion Church organized here in 1844. Blairsville's anti-slavery leadership included wealthy merchant John Graff and black community leader Lewis Johnson. Collaborating with them in UGRR activities were men, women and children acting as conductors, agents, suppliers and watchmen plus a citizenry willing to challenge, in one way or another, attempts by slave hunters to 'kidnap' runaways. Black community members led two citizen 'rescues' of freedom seekers, one in 1858 and the other in 1860. The Blairsville Passport to Freedom UGRR Experience interprets UGRR, anti-slavery and African-American activities in the county. Interpretive activities include walking tours, cemetery , driving tours, living history programs and yearly re-enactments."

    "ABSTRACT":"Eden Cemetery is the oldest African American owned cemetery in the U.S. Located in Collingdale, Delaware county, Pennsylvania, it is comprised of 53 beautiful rolling acres. The Cemetery was established on June 20, 1902 and today there are over 85,000 interred at Eden. Buried at Eden are abolitionists and Underground Railroad activists. These include William Still, Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, Stephen Smith, Octavius Valentine Catto and members of the First African Baptist Church (1823-1842). The most famous of these being William Still, the \"father of the underground railroad.\" Still was laid to rest here in 1902. Still's interviews with former slaves, including one who turned out to be his long lost brother Peter, grew into the book \"The Underground Railroad\", published in 1872. Buried with him are his wife Letitia and his daughter Caroline."

    "ABSTRACT":"This small building is set at the back of a deep lot at the edge of farm fields and is surrounded by a cemetery with many unmarked burials and some with simple headstones. Tradition has passed down in Odessa that the meeting house was used as a station on the Underground Railroad. Whether freedom seekers were hidden here or not, the property is associated with the Underground Railroad through the attending members that were ardently anti-slavery and acted on those beliefs. Their lives are reflected in this building, where those individuals came to explore and reaffirm their faith. Buried in the cemetery are members of the Alston and Hunn families. One member, John Hunn, was sued by the owners of an enslaved family he assisted on their journey north. John Alston, the primary caretaker of the property, is documented as assisting Molly, a freedom seeker from Smyrna, Delaware, in Still's Underground Railroad of 1872."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Corbit-Sharp House in Odessa, Delaware was the home of a noted Underground Railroad sympathizer and was the site of a close-call on the Underground Railroad described in a later-in-life reminiscence of a child of the family. A freedom seeker named Sam asked for and received refuge from a quickly pursuing sheriff. The urgency of the situation is documented in a vivid account given by Mary Corbit Warner, the fourth child of prominent Quakers Daniel and Mary C. Corbit, in a speech to the Delaware Chapter of the Colonial Dames of America in 1914. According to Mary's account, her father was away from the home when Sam arrived at the back door seeking aid. Her mother quickly decided to hide Sam in a small eave closet in the attic accessed only by a very small door. The pursuing sheriff requested to examine the house for the fugitive. Mrs. Corbit toured him through looking in every room. Access to the eave closet was not requested, as the young girl recalled, because he commented it was too small to hide the man he sought. Mary's father had a repution for being willing to assit freedom seekers as noted in Still's 1872 book, \"The Underground Railroad.\""

On this lot stood the home of Jameson Jenkins, who was a successful drayman living in Springfield during the 1850s. Jenkins lived one block south of Abraham Lincoln.\n\nOn January 16, 1850, Jameson Jenkins assisted a group of runaway slaves escape the hands of slave catchers and took them north to the next stop on the Underground Railroad: Bloomington, Illinois. During the following days, both town newspapers reported various and contradictory stories regarding the runaway slaves, them being caught, and the person who betrayed them. The newspapers later revealed that the person who assisted the runaway slaves was Jameson Jenkins. The newspaper also explained the reasoning behind the various contradictory stories was so that the Underground Railroad car that Jenkins traveled on would not be discovered.\n\nToday the Jenkins lot is located within Lincoln Home National Historic Site, which contains the home of Abraham Lincoln within a historical neighborhood setting. However, the lot is empty, the original Jenkins house was razed sometime between 1896 and 1917. The location of the lot; within a National Park, ensures that archeological resources related to the home of Jameson Jenkins are preserved."

    "ABSTRACT":"Grantham and Forrest Farm is the site of escape from enslavement by Benjamin Tillotson (Abram Tilison). The plantation, located in Kent County, Maryland, was owned by Samuel Jarman. Tillotson ran away from Jarman in 1857, during a religious camp-meeting, because he was afraid he would be sold to Georgia upon the death of his master. Tillotson traveled north on the Underground Railroad, hiding in barns and coming close to being captured. He made it to Philadelphia where his account was recorded by William Still and sent on to St. Catharines, Ontario. While in Canada he became an active member of his community and his life story was recorded by a neighboring white man, Fred Parnell. This case highlights many elements of the Underground Railroad and the abolition movement. Still's account and Tillotson's own describe Jarman differently. Still protrays Jarman as an abusive and unsympathetic slaveholder, while Tillotson describes him as a lenient and good-natured man. Still needed to publicize the evils of slavery, and his treatment of Jarman is the result of his anti-slavery agenda. Tillotson's own description gives us an unprecedented account as to what life was like for slaves in Kent County."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Abyssinian Meeting House (1828) in Portland, Maine, is the historical, religious, educational and cultural center of Portland's 19th century African American population. It is the earliest meeting house associated with a black population in Maine and the third oldest extant African American meeting house in New England. The Abyssinian Congregation is closely associated with the Underground Railroad and with local abolitionists activity prior to and during the Civil War. Because of its easy access by rail and sea, Portland developed as one of the northernmost hubs of the UGRR system, the last stop before freedom. When the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 allowed slave owners and agents to track down escaped runaways in the north and return them to slavery, black and white activists in Portland provided safe houses and refuge for and helped organize escape routes to England and Canada. The ministers, leaders and members of the Abyssinian actively participated in concealing, supplying, and transporting runaways."

During the 1840s, Marshall residents expressed strong antislavery sentiments through the press, political organizations, and community resistance to slavery. In addition to hosting a meeting of the Michigan Antislavery Society in 1842, Marshall residents helped create one of Michigans' most notable responses to slavery in 1847. Adam and Sarah Crosswhite and their four children escaped from slavery and the Carroll County, Kentucky farm of Francis Giltner in August 1843. The Crosswhites settled in Marshall and helped establish the growing African American community there. In 1847, Giltner representatives attempt to recapture the Crosswhites in Marshall resulted in a trial that captured the attention of many and garnered extensive press coverage. The jury decided the people of Marshall had violated the 1793 Fugitive Slave Act and the court ordered payment to the Kentuckians. This marker shows a step on that road to freedom."

Dressed in her Quaker bonnet, holding a copy of her autobiography \"A Woman's Life Work\" in her right hand, she smiles gently down at those who come to drink. Bronze plaques on the base relate her heroic deeds. Haviland is remembered for her work as a conductor on the Underground Railroad. She and her husband are credited with founding the first integrated school in Michigan. Haviland was an out spoken advocate for African Americans both in Michigan and nationally. The drinking fountain was dedicated on June 24, 1909 by the residents of Adrian. Funds were raised from a variety of community sources including Haviland's family and the local chapter of the Women's Christian Temperance Union."

In the 1890s, both Pamela and Nathan reported, not only their own stories, but accounted for at least 30 men in communities such as Vandalia, Jackson, Battle Creek, Climax, Ann Arbor, Marshall, and Detroit who assisted African Americans escaping slavery. In addition to those who aided African Americans, the Thomas' detailed the history and structure of this important network."

Throught its first three decades, FCC as a congregation, some of its ministers such as Rev. Harvey D. Kitchel, and Rev. Oren C. Thompson and individual members such as Silas Holmes and Samuel P. Mead established substantial contributions to the Underground Railroad and antislavery efforts. FCC, during its early history, demonstrated consistent monetary support of escaped formerly enslaved individuals through Rev. Kitchel's chater membership in and the church's sustained financial support of the Refugees' Home Society (RHS)."

    "ABSTRACT":"Abigail Goodwin, humanitarian, abolitionist, and Underground Railroad operative, was born in Salem, remaining a lifelong resident. In 1814, she became one of the founding members of the Female Benevolent Society of Salem, an organization dedicated to the relief of the infirm, aged, unemployed, and those widowed with small children. During the 1830s she became active in the Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society and is recognized by the State of New Jersey \"probably the foremost female New Jerseyan associated with the work of aiding fugitive southern slaves.\" Constructed in 1821, by 1838 the two-story house became a UGRR station operated by Abigail Goodwin. William Still said that she was \"one of the rare, true friends to the Underground Railroad, whose labors entitle her name to be mentioned in terms of very high praise. Letters of sympathy accompanied with bags of stockings, clothing, and donations of money were not unfrequent for her.\" In addition to this work, Abigail also acted as a conductor, sheltering slaves in their escape to freedom. One documented case involves Sam Nixon, who would later be known as Dr. Thomas Bayne, passing through Salem in March 1855. She remained active in the abolitionist cause to her death."

AKWAABA members are storytellers, teachers, parents, an historian, a poet, a musician, all longtime Rochester residents seeking to preserve and perpetuate the legacy bequeathed by 19th century freedom advocates. Riverstroll takes visitors on a guided tour of sites associated with freedom and the Underground Railroad. The tour begins at Main Street, at the river, where the hamlet, Rochesterville began in the early 1800s. Visitors then take a short ride to another locale, where other segments of the freedom trail unfolded. Along the way visitors will hear and learn about Austin Steward, Frederick Douglass and Susan B. Anthony. There is also a stop at Mt. hope Cemetery where many of these freedom advocates are buried."

    "ABSTRACT":"Laypersons gathered at Plymouth Church in 1847 and called as their first minister the Rev. Henry Ward Beecher. In early years, Henry C. Bowen, Harriet Beecher Stowe and Lewis Tappan were in the congregation. They and others had such a wide range of activities related to the Underground Railroad that it was not an overstatement for an early historian of the church to assert that the church was \"the Grand Central Depot of the Underground Railroad.\" They helped fund the New York State Vigilance Committee which delivered fugitives from slavery to the church as an Underground Railroad station. They purchased the freedom of persons who had been captured when fleeing slavery or who were seeking freedom. In some of these purchases of freedom, Rev Beecher performed mock slave auctions to communicate the horrors of the purchase and sale of human beings. At a time when many northern churches were reluctant to take a stand against slavery, the congregation and minister opposed the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 and, when it passed, opposed its enforcement. Through her novel Uncle Tom's Cabin, Harriet Beecher Stowe introduced Americans to stories of bondage and also of escapes through the Underground Railroad."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Sandy Ground Historical Society was formed in 1979 to preserve the history and physical surroundings of the Sandy Ground Community and also to maintain and promote the legacy of the community, as it is an important part of American History. The community was made up of newly freed slaves from the New York metropolitan area and later joined by freedman who had been working many years in the oyster industry in the waters around Delmar Peninsula. Laws restricting their livelihood and their freedom forced them to leave the Maryland/Virginia area and settle in Sandy Ground, a station on the Underground Railroad. The Museum continuously promotes the community's culture and heritage through lectures, exhibits, arts, and music. Throughout the year, many of the programming and educational events are centered on the history of Sandy Ground and the Underground Railroad. In 2006, the traveling exhibit \"Slavery in New York\", a nine panel exhibition developed by the New York Historical Society was featured at the Sandy Ground Musuem along with a companion exhibit developed by the Sandy Ground Historical Society, \"Images of Slavery , Beyond\"."

    "ABSTRACT":"Solomon Northup was born a free man in Minerva, NY, July 1808. Solomon was a literate man who worked on the Champlain Canal. While working as a cabbie and violinist in Saratoga Springs, he was abducted, held in a slave pen in Washington, DC, and sold into slavery in Louisiana for 12 years before regaining his freedom. Citizens of Saratoga and surrounding areas were instrumental in arranging for Solomon's release in 1853 and return to Saratoga. Mr. Northup published his autobiography Twelve Years A Slave in 1853 about his ordeal. It is believed he traveled throughout the region selling his book and speaking out against slavery and was himself an abolitionist. Although Mr. Northup sought to bring his captors to trial, they were never prosecuted and he mysteriously disappeared. To date, his burial site has not been identified and it is not known whether or not he was killed, re-captured or died of natural causes. The city of Saratoga Springs has installed a marker near his capture site and since 1999, Renee Moore established the annual event Solomon Northup Day,\n\nThis event is celebrated third Saturday in July each year with descendants and has been recognized by the City and the North Country Underground Railroad Historical Association (NCUGRHA) , Plattsburgh. These annual educational program have focused on New York's African American history of the Underground Railroad.  The event was honored by Congress at the Library of Congress in year 2000 as part of their \"Local Legacies Bicentennial Celebration. \" In 2016, the event was a Tri-City event with the Old Fort House Museum of Fort Edward, Schroon Lake Historical Society and the NCUGRHA in Plattsburgh.  The event is held in different locations, but recently at Plattsburgh at the North Star Museum by the NCUGRHA.

    "ABSTRACT":"The Cumberland County Old Courthouse, located in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, has played an important role in the history of the Underground Railroad. This nomination includes five known UGRR incidents that occurred at the courthouse. The first was when a slave owner named Anderson, requested custody of a man named Jim, whom he claimed was his fugitive slave. He went before the Court of Common Pleas of Cumberland County with two witnesses who support his claim. The next incident occurred in 1847, and is known today as the McClintock riot. After three freedom seekers found their way to Carlisle, their owners forcibly entered a private home near Shippensburg in order to capture them. This incident led to the slave owners having to appear in court, and eventually to the illegal imprisonment of the fugitives. At the trial a riot broke out in front of the courthouse, leading to the death of one of the slave owners and the escape of the freedom seekers. Also in 1847, the Kaufman Case was heard at the courthouse. This case was about Daniel Kaufman's work on the Underground Railroad and his aiding thirteen fugitives at his home in Boiling Springs, Pennsylvania. In 1850, the Burns Family incident occurred in which a young black man was lured into a carriage and taken back to Maryland to be sold as a slave. The fifth known incident occurred in 1859, when slave catchers in the middle of the night abducted the Butler Family. The catcher was found and put on trial for kidnapping."

Once in Erie, freedom seekers could then continue north across Lake Erie into Canada or head east through the state of New York. Some opted to remain in the region. Abolitionists and the free black community provided freedom seekers with a safe place to stay, new clothes, and a quick change of appearance at the local barbershop. The Journey to Freedom educational program was created to help tell this story. Journey to Freedom is an interactive Underground Railroad program for Erie County. A component of the interactive program consists of pre and post-visit activities. The activities include Methods of Escape, Escape Routes, Narratives, Erie's Abolitionists and a Timeline Creation. The Program incorporates historical photographs and documents, role-playing activities and games."

    "ABSTRACT":"The village of Boiling Springs was the site of an Underground Railroad station located on one of the major escape routes leading from Maryland to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The area included an iron making complex where freedom seekers were sheltered by some of the free black employees. Daniel Kaufman, who lived on a farm near the ironworks, operated a station at his home and in a secluded wooded area near his home known as Island Grove. A number of village residents, including some of his relatives, assisted Daniel with his work. Daniel Kaufman was sued by a Maryland slave owner in 1847 for assisting thirteen of her slaves who were last traced to his home. This lawsuit led to three trials that attracted statewide attention. Kaufman lost his case in Federal Court and had to pay fines and expenses amounting to approximately $5,000. Daniel Kaufman was one of the youngest and consequently one of the last surviving agents on the UGRR when he died in 1902. His work as an agent and the UGRR activities in the Boiling Springs area are well documented because of the transcripts of two of his trials and the resulting newspaper coverage."

Stories of Freedom Seekers, abolitionists and events such as the Christiana Resistance combine to tell a compelling narrative of this area just north of the Mason Dixon Line. Connections to surrounding communities such as Gettysburg, York , Philadelphia are woven throughout the tour narrative. The Pennsylvania Quest for Freedom: Lancaster County Tour was introduced in 2006, following three years of extensive research and development conducted through a partnership of the Pennsylvania Tourism Office, the Pennsylvania Dutch Convention , Visitors Bureau, regional tourism partners, and the Pennsylvania Historical Museum Commission."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Mid-Atlantic Regional Archives is the repository for official U.S. government historical records for the states of PA, MD, DE, VA, and WV. The Mid-Atlantic holdings date from the founding of the early national government and contain details on the actions and decisions of government officials and the public in confronting the issues of slavery and the status of blacks in America. Court and Customs records document the Atlantic slave trade, including the domestic trade between the Port of Philadelphia and southern ports such as Charleston, New Orleans, and Savannah. Other federal court records include cases related to fugitive slaves, who fled from southern plantations to Pennsylvania in the 1840s and 1850s. Among these records are the cases of Passmore Williamson and the Christiana Riot. Both are considered nationally significant U.S. anti-slavery incidents following the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, and were causes celebre for the abolition movement. Correspondence from Ft. Monroe documents the employment of freed slaves and the construction of separate quarters for them after the Emancipation Proclamation. Records of the Schuylkill and Frankdord Arsenal document freed slaves' participation in material support of Union troops."

    "ABSTRACT":"Philadelphia Quest for Freedom is an interpretive program about Philadelphia's pivotal role in the Underground Railroad centering on the under-told story of Philadelphia's free Black community (the largest in the north) which was instrumental in forming some of the nation's first independent Black religious and social empowerment institutions that were the forerunners of today's Civil Rights organizations. This influential Black community joined forces with Quakers and other sympathetic whites to form highly successful anti-slavery institutions that had both national and international impact. A strong and diverse regional network of more than 30 sites and six communitities serves as the framework for Philadelphia Quest for Freedom. Unlike traditional trails established for the Underground Railroad, Philadelphia Quest for Freedom enables the public to experience more of the complexities and interlocking nature of the stories and communities. Starting at Independence National Historical Park, where the Liberty Bell, Independence Hall and the new President's House Commemorative Site are located, Philadelphia Quest for Freedom profoundly and deeply grounds the Underground Railroad story within the national experience, and provides a context and catalyst for civic engagement in both past and contemporary issues."

    "ABSTRACT":"One of the many events from the Spotsylvania County Courthouse and Jail is the story of George Boxley and his involvement in the struggle to end slavery in the early 1800s. George Boxley was a white storekeeper and mill owner. While living in Berkeley Parrish, Spotsylvania County, Virginia, he allegedly tried to coordinate a local slave rebellion in 1815, based on \"heaven-sent\" orders to free the enslaved. His plan was for slaves from Spotsylvania, and surrounding counties to meet at his home with horses, guns, swords and cubs. His plan involved capturing Richmond's magazine or arsenal, and from there he planned to help the participating enslaved reach freedom. An enslaved girl, Lucy, informed her owner, Ptolemy Powell, who then informed the magistrate. The plot was foiled. At least six enslaved people were executed and many others were arrested. Boxley was able to escape from the Spotsylvania County Jail when his wife, brought him a file, which he used to cut his chains and escape to freedom. A thousand dollars reward was offered for Boxley, but he was never caught. Boxley fled to Indiana, where he continued to help runaways and teach the principles of abolitionism on the railway to freedom."

    "ABSTRACT":"As a documentary photographer/digital artist, there are two components to the program that I provide: lecture and exhibition. The exhibition is comprised of two types of images, composited views of UGRR sites, and montages that address the broader landscape of slavery through a constructed narrative form. Each UGRR work visually describes an individual location inside and out, including significant architectural features, historical materials, and other details that reveal the story about that site. In order to provide a view into the greater context of slavery and the struggle for freedom, the companion montages blend together images of pertinent locations with historical documents, illustrations, and other artifacts, along with contemporary cultural references. In exhibition, descriptive text accompanies the work.\n\nIn addition to exhibitions, I often make lecture presentations with projected visual images of my research. I share the histories of the UGRR sites, and describe the elements incorporated into the montages. I emphasize the importance of understanding our history, and that African American history is American history. Depending on the audience, I also discuss the value of visual documentation and other interpretative strategies for preservation, and for making this history come to life for others, especially younger audiences."

    "ABSTRACT":"Through the powerful medium of jazz, and honoring the profound importance of music in Harriet Tubman's life, Shelby's oratorio tells the remarkable story of Harriet Tubman, a woman who rose out of humble beginnings, escaped slavery, and dedicated her life to challenging the grace injustices in her dayWorking though the Underground Railroad, Tubman personally led 70 slaves, mostly family and friends, out of bondage at great risk to her own life, and inspired dozens more to grasp freedom on their own. During the Civil War, she led raids for the Union and served as a nurse, scout, and spy. After Emancipation, Tubman turned her great energy toward the woman's suffrage movement, again hoping to push our nation to live up to its responsibility to stand for true civil rights for all. Throughout her life, this courageous woman worked to unite American women and men of all colors and classes in a common struggle for liberty. \"Harriet Tubman Bound for the Promised Land\" is an original secular oratorio for jazz orchestra and chorus composed and written byMarcus Shelby, based on the critically acclaimed biography, Bound For the Promised Land: Harriet Tubman, Portrait of an American Hero, by Kate Clifford Larson (Ballantine/One World, 2004). The oratorio and supporting outreach and education materials tell, through music, the compelling story of Harriet Tubman, a genuine American hero. Marcus Shelby has received generous support from several San Francisco area arts, cultural, and educational organizations and institutions, including the CreativeWork Fund, the LEF Foundation, and the Committee for Black Performing Arts at Stanford University to compose a new work on the life of Harriet Tubman."

    "ABSTRACT":"Leonard Andrew Grimes (1815-1873), an African American born free in Loudoun County, Virginia, is significant to the Underground Railroad (UGRR) because he was a documented UGRR activist, first in Washington, DC, and then in Boston, Massachusetts. Grimes served 2 years in the Virginia penitentiary as a result of circumstantial evidence of help to an escaping enslaved family. After his release from prison, he and his family moved to Massachusetts. Once he became a Baptist preacher, he was called to serve at the Twelfth Baptist Church in Boston. While in Boston, he assisted the Boston Vigilance Committee and was involved in preventing the returns to slavery of freedom seekers Anthony Burns (unsuccessful), Shadrack Minkins, and Thomas Sims under the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act. There is good documentation for Grimes' UGRR activities: trial records in Leesburg, and sources for Boston like Frances Jackson's Vigilance Committee ledgers. The best place to commemorate Grimes is the site of his property in DC where recently a plaque was placed. An indenture signing land over to his uncle while Grimes served his prison term establishes the location of his property at 22nd and H Streets, N.W."

    "ABSTRACT":"From the establishment of the Dickinson Plantation in 1740 until the 19th century, Slavery impacted the lives of more than sixty men, women, and children, as practiced on St. Jones Neck in Kent County, Delaware. The Plantation is the boyhood home of John Dickinson, a Delaware participant in the conventions that created the founding documents of this nation, Declaration of Independence, Articles of Confederation and the federal Constitution. Called a \"great worthy of the Revolution\" by Thomas Jefferson, Dickinson inherited the plantation in 1760 and this experience, along with religious influences, helped him develop a personal philosophy about slavery over his lifetime. The Plantation, as a historic microcosm, chronicles social tensions surrounding the status of individuals who lived and worked on the plantation: free, enslaved, and manumitted; black and white. During the time of Dickinson's ownership, at least three slaves attempted to flee. The conditions of life and the subsequent escape of Clem, a slave of a Dickinson plantation tenant William White, is well documented."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Carnegie Center for Art and History houses a permanent, award-winning exhibition title, Ordinary People, Extraordinary Courage: Men and Women of the UGRR. The exhibit examines the antislavery community in Floyd County, Indiana, and places it in a broader context by describing the social, economic, and cultural contours of the Falls region of the Ohio River Valley. This project explores three broad themes that are critical to understanding the nature of the UGRR as it existed in Southern Indiana. First, it draws attention away from the traditional Boston-New York-Oberlin abolitionist nexus and points to the significance of antislavery activism along the Ohio River. Second, the project draws attention to the biracial nature of abolitionism, particularly at the local level. Finally, the project reveals the central role played by African Americans in the UGRR and provides an unprecedented look at the black community of the Falls region."

Chapman came to Jefferson County, IN as a 37-year-old single man in 1837 from Virginia. He was soon sworn in and joined the fight for freedom for his race. His first UGRR assignment was to take a runaway slave to lancaster where he worked with John H. Tibbets and Mr. Neslon."

    "ABSTRACT":"Essex county in the 19th century was the home to many abolitionists who actively sought the end of slavery and took the risk of providing shelter and transportation for those runaways entering the county seeking to live as free people. Blacks and whites worked together to secretly assist freedom seekers and fought slavery publicly through formal societies, meetings, lectures and publications. Well documented areas and people involved in the UGRR in MA were identified by Professor Wilber Siebert in his 1936 book of the same name. Salem Maritime NHS staff and community members sought verification and solicitation for new information within Essex county. The information culminated in the 2005 publication which visually identified those sites extant today. Poets, Shoemakers and Freedom Seekers was created to accompany the publication. The program highlights the work of significant people and freedom seekers who traveled through Essex county."

    "ABSTRACT":"The house at 960 Main St in Leicester, MA, was the home of radical abolitionist Samuel May Jr. (1810-1899)from his marriage in 1835 until his death. General agent of the Massachusettes Anti-Slavery Society for eighteen years and a member of the Boston Vigilance Committee of 1850-61, May was one of the most active fugitive assistants in that city. Committee records document twenty-seven separate instances of his aid to fugitives in those years, and other accounts establish his role in other cases not mentioned in those records. May arranged for the escape of famed fugitives William and Ellen Craft to England and accompanied them on one leg of their journey, and he was directly involved in the Anthony Burns episode of May and June 1854. His assistance to fugitives included advancing rent money and buying clothing and groceries, arranging their movement to Canada and paying their fares, and sending funds to fugitives in both the U.S. and Canada to contribute to their support. Some evidence indicates that his Leicester home also sheltered fugitives. May fought for abolitionism until the Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery and remained active in the fight for racial equality afterwards."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Best Farm is a component of Monocacy National Battlefield, a major National Park Service Civil War battlefield site, located south of the city of Frederick in Frederick County, Maryland. The Best Farm is named for the tenant family who occupied it before and during the Civil War; however, it was once part of a 748-acre plantation known as L'Hermitage, which was established by the Vincendieres, a family of French planters from the Caribbean. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries L'Hermitage was home to the second-largest enslaved population in Frederick County, and documents indicate that the owners instituted a harsh form of slavery. Even after the Vincendieres sold the property, slavery continued to be practiced here. Given the inhumanity of slavery, historic research indicates that at L'Hermitage and the Best Farm, freedom seekers exercised personal agency by attempting to escape. The National Park Service has undertaken extensive historical and archeological studies, and as a result L'Hermitage is well-documented through land records, wills, newspaper advertisements, lawsuits, and census records. During the Vincendieres' tenure (50-90 bondsmen), there is documentation of runaway slaves. The names of the escaping men and dates of the runaway advertisements are: Phil (1795) and Jerry (1795). During the Best family's residence on the same site, there is a runaway advertisement for Lewis Owens (1850)."

    "ABSTRACT":"Arthur W. Leverton, a recently documented agent of the Underground Railroad, owned this property from 1848 until 1859. Long suspected of being active in the UGRR in the Preston area, his role revealed in early January of 1858 after fugitive slaves, Margaret Haskins, her husband and four children, were captured, jailed and interrogated and Arthur Leverton was connected to the escape. Threatened by rumors of a gathering mob of vengeful slaveholders, he fled Caroline County within two weeks of his exposure as an agent, leaving behind his family, home, farm and livelihood. Re-settled in Indiana - where many other Quakers had migrated to be rid of the institution of slavery - the family never regained the financial prosperity provided by his productive farm. His farm was critical to what appears to have been a large refuge for fugitives from slavery - a target of 1,400 contiguous acres of land owned by Quakers and free blacks in the Preston area, one of whom was Arthur's father, Jacob."

This sixty-eight mile river served as a route and a barrier to freedom during the antebellum period. With its headwaters near the Delaware border, freedom seekers from the region could travel by boat or follow its banks northeast and be within fifty miles of the Pennsylvania line and freedom. Using their own maritime skills, relying on the aid of other mariners, or secreting themselves aboard vessels sailing along the river, freedom seekers used a variety of resources to utilize the river as their means of escape from slavery."

The Guide interprets the significance of over 30 attractions, facilities, museums, guided tours, and historic sites, providing information on how to locate and visit each site. The Guide also defines and describes the intricacies of the UGRR in MD, a border state whose dependence upon slavery was linked to a changing agricultural and maritime economy. Here, freedom seekers' experiences were much different compared to those in the Deep South. The abundance of waterways provided both an escape route and barrier to potential fugitives. The Guide describes the UGRR and why it existed in MD. Visitors will discover how ordinary people in a southern slaveholding community faced challenges to help others secure freedom."

People called her the Moses of her people, and she became an icon of the Underground Railroad, In 1859, she purchased land in Auburn, New York, from William Henry and Frances Seward. Except for her service as spy, nurse, and scout during the Civil War, she lived there, creating a haven for family and friends and a home for the elderly until her death on March 10, 1913. She was buried in Fort Hill Cemetery near her nephew, her nephew's wife, and her second husband, Nelson Davis, under a large cedar tree. Her original gravestone was replaced in 1937 by the Empire State Federation of Women's Clubs. Today, her grave remains a place of pilgrimage."

    "ABSTRACT":"Samuel C. Cuyler (1808-1872), Elizabeth Julia Cuyler, and son Ledyard Cuyler, descendents of major Dutch families in New York, kept the most important Underground Railroad station on Lake Ontario's shore between Oswego and Rochester, in Pultneyville, New York. The Cuylers sent freedom seekers to Canada on steamboats operated by a relative, Captain Horatio Nelson Throop, aided by small boats sailed by Ledyard and an African American called \"Black Bob.\" In 1838, Samuel championed the right of black abolitionist Samuel R. Ward to speak. Believing that the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution were antislavery documents, Cuyler supported the Liberty Party in 1840 and the Free Soil Party in 1848. In 1855, he was elected to the New York State Senate as a Republican. For seven years, he served as U.S. Customs Collector in Pultneyville. Evidence for the Cuylers' UGRR work includes letters, contemporary articles, accounts in Wayne county local histories and an oral history from Ledyard Cuyler in 1907."

    "ABSTRACT":"\"Harry's Great Escape\" Harry was one of the many enslaved workers who escaped from the Philadelphia Chew Family. He first prepared the Chews for an escape by establishing a modus operandi of independent operation, then slipped away when nobody was watching. The search for Harry covered at least a four-year span. The Chew Family were called the owners of the largest slave population in colonial Delaware and Pennsylvania. Many others escaped; some were caught and punished, and there were advertisements for those who were 'lost'. The Chew's enslaved Negroes experienced many of the situations that marked the long struggle between bondage and freedom. Not surprisingly, we see these struggles from the owner's viewpoint, but often on an unusually intimate basis. The materials that tell Henry's story were all sent or received in the summer, while the Chews were at Cliveden, their country estate. Other escape stories include seeking runaways in Salem County, New Jersey and paying expenses for a runaway who had been captured and jailed in Philadelphia."

A former slave, orator, writer, politician, advisor to Presidents, and an affirmative voice for everybody's inalienable right to freedom, Douglass was also a conductor of the Underground Railroad. He is the human example behind the institute and its belief in the critical role of education in the organized life of a democracy. The Institute is an academic program that supports, promotes, and advocates the study of Doulgass and his life and times. A major activity in the life of the Institute is the relationship between Douglass and his support of the elimination of slavery; the UGRR was one of the major forms of resistance to the culture of slavery. The Institute is committed to implementing its mission by developing areas of scholarship and research for understanding the UGRR movement in our society."

Through lessons, readings, discussions, films, music, arts and crafts, drama, and field trips,participants in grades four to eight (age nine to fourteen) will learn about the history of the UGRR. The Program is designed to spark and keep an interest in this critical and most important phase of America's history. At the conclusion of the camp, participants will know about the history of enslavement in America and the lives and contributions of the people who struggled and worked diligently in the fight for freedom to end enslavement of African people. Participants will learn about the transatlantic slave trade, the middle passage, William Still, Robert Purvis, Henry \"Box\" Brown, the Crafts and others."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Prince William County Courthouse and Jail in Brentsville, VA, are associated with the Underground Railroad because they served as sites of arrest and lodging of runaway bondsmen and abolitionists from 1820 until 1862. Bondsmen were tried, lodged, punished (including execution) and sold all on the courthouse lot. Relevant cases are: runaway named Billy documented because of treatment at the jail on 3 succeeding days by a local physician; free black William Hyden unjustly imprisoned in the Brentsville Jail and almost sold into slavery in 1833; Landon a runaway held in the jail, charged with arson, tried, and found guilty, and sentenced to be hung in 1839. Period newspapers provide evidence of antislavery sentiment in the county. Vocal abolitionist John Underwood was brought to trial and found guilty of \"uttering and maintaining that owners have no rights of property in their slaves.\" This and other cases show how the county courts tried to repress opposition to slavery within the county. The courthouse and jail are part of the Brentsville Courthouse Historic Centre, administered by Prince William County's Historic Preservation Division. The courthouse is open for tours and the jail is under restoration."

    "ABSTRACT":"In the spring of 1861, at the start of the Civil War, 20-year-old Hortense Prout made a daring bid for freedom from this site in Washington, DC, where she worked as an enslaved servant in the manor house of John Little. Little held 12 enslaved African Americans on his cattle farm, including 3 generations of the Prout family. Hortense fled during a time of great excitement in DC, as thousands of newly organized Union troops poured into the city to quell the rebel uprising in VA. We know of her escape only because the Washington Evening Star on June 17, 1861, reported on her capture: she was found in an encampment of OH soldiers, about 2 miles east of John Little's house. She was, according to the newspaper , \"completely rigged out in male attire.\" As punishment, John Little put Hortense in the City Jail for \"safekeeping,\" before taking her back to work in his home. Less than a year after her escape, President Lincoln in April 1862 declared all enslaved African Americans in DC free. Hortense Prout thus became one of the last Washingtonians who chose to risk her life to win freedom."

The best place to commemorate the escape and achievement of this aspiration for Emily Plummer and her younger children, is at the home of Emily Plummer's husband Adam Plummer at the Calvert plantation Riversdale, in Prince George's County, Maryland (MD). Here Adam brought back his wife and children to live in freedom after they escaped from a plantation in Ellicott City, MD, were caught, jailed in Baltimore, and could not be reclaimed by their master.\n\nThe lives of Adam and Emily Plummer are remarkably well documented considering both were born and raised enslaved. Records on the lives of the Plummers include a book by their daughter Nellie Arnold Plummer called \"Out of the Depths,\" letters between Emily and Adam Plummer, and newly recovered portions of a diary by Adam Plummer, now held at Anacostia Museum.\nRiversdale is now a house museum, owned and operated by Maryland National Capital Park and Planning Commission. Riversdale interprets the attainment of freedom for this family through a booklet on Adam Plummer and his family, an exhibit panel, and occasional events commemorating the lives of the Plummer family.\n"

    "ABSTRACT":"In 1673, Charles Calvert, the third Lord Baltimore, granted a 1000-acre tract of land to Thomas Sprigg. Named Northampton, this Prince George's County, Maryland, property was the home of the Sprigg Family and their servants and enslaved African Americans for nearly 200 years. Numerous descendants of slaves and tenants from Northamption still reside in Prince George's County, Maryland. Six clans can link their families to a common ancestor, Elizabeth Hawkins, who lived at Northampton during the 1800's. Northampton is associated with the Underground Railroad due to runaway ads appearing in two different Washington, D.C., newspapers. Osborn Sprigg, Jr., great-grandson to Thomas Sprigg, placed multiple runaway ads in The Centinel of Liberty for both \"Charles\" and \"Bob\" in 1800. Later, Samuel Sprigg, former Governor of Maryland and nephew to Osborn Sprigg, Jr., placed runaway ads in the Daily National Intelligencer for \"Billy\" and Clem\" in 1815, \"...Clem and his wife Sophy...\" from 1817 to 1819, \"Tom\" and \"Joe\" in 1820, and \"William\" in 1836."

The Snow Camp Historical Drama Society (SCHDS) is known for its yearly outdoor historical dramas--the only outdoor dram in North Carolina specifically about the UGRR--\"Pathway to Freedom\". \"Pathway to Freedom\" is a dramatic portrayal of the peace-loving Quakers who were adamantly against slavery and their involvement and contributions to the UGRR. Along with the actors portraying the struggles faced during that time thru drama, the atmosphere is further brought to life through traditional African American Spirituals. \"Pathway to Freedom\" is an excellent tool in educating the public on how people from our community contributed to the UGRR."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Brooklyn Historical Society's (BHS) collections include significant original archival materials that are essential to the story of abolition and underground railroad in Brooklyn. These include the papers of Henry Ward Beecher, a huge collection of slave papers: sermons (pro and con), lectures, and newspaper clippings from the 1840s through the 1860s, artifacts such as Henry Ward Beecher's pulpit chair, and extensive collection of early photographs, including early daguerreotypes and stereo cards. BHS' archives contains materials on related sites in Brooklyn such as Weeksville, Lafayette Avenue Presbyterian Church, and Plymouth Church/Church of the Pilgrims records from the 1850s - 1950s. BHS also has had land conveyances from the 19th century and earlier that would list property transactions, especially for private residences that may have been part of the Underground Railroad. Additionally, the BHS collection of maps and street atlases will also provide excellent images for use in the mapping of local historic sites and in the interpretive exhibitions."

The N-YHS was one of the very few institutions collecting during the height of the Underground Railroad movement from the 1830s to 1860s and even earlier during the existence of prototypes such as the Manumission Society. Our materials are unique and broad-ranging, incomparable sources for the study of slavery, resistance, abolition and flight.The N-YHS' Henry Luce III Center for the Study of American Culture, located on the 4th floor of our Central Park West headquarters, houses a permanent exhibition relating to slavery in New York and the Underground Railroad's history, with a virtual exhibition tour, text panels and original art and artifacts from the N-YHS' collection. Elsewhere in the Center are several hundred relevant artifacts and paintings€including portraits of Frederick Douglass, James McCune Smith and other Underground Railroad leaders€that can always be seen by the public.\n\n\nFor more information, please visit: http://www.slaveryinnewyork.org and http://www.newyorkdivided.org."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Hudson Library , Historical Society is a primary research facility in Northeastern Ohio for regional and local Hudson area history, including a sizable collection relative to famed abolitionist, John Brown and the Underground Railroad.\n\nIn the summer of 1832, Western Reserve College and the community of Hudson, Ohio was torn asunder by the abolition versus colonization debate. This debate was especially heated and precipitated the removal of the college administration. It also caused a split in the Hudson Congregatonal Church, which fostered the birth of the Free Congregational Church of Hudson, Ohio with John Brown's father, Owen Brown, leading the newlyformedchurch. Hudson's history as an abolitionist town was further bolstered as several nationally known advocates such as Frederick Douglass often came to Hudson to speak or visit with the Brown family.\n\nHudson's extensive collection also includes various church records, property records, individual letters, abolitionist tracts, numerous period newspapers and other first person accounts that both attest to local Underground Railroad activity or help provide vital clues and connections for further research. Hudson also cherishes documents donated by Brown family descendants and collections from other abolitionists such as Beriah Green and Elizur Wright Jr."

Abram Ritner, son of the Commonwealth's anti-slavery Governor Joseph Ritner, is described as both a \"conductor\" on the UGRR and as an actual conductor on the region's interstate railroad, which was one of the earliest established in the country. Purchased in 1849, the Ritner home was operated as a boarding house as early as 1852 by Mary Ritner, Abram Ritner's widow. She is reported to have aided scores of freedom seekers there. While in Chambersburg, John Brown pruchased tools and brought in weapons which were transported to his attack headquarters in Maryland, a few miles from Harper's Ferry. Over his stay in Chambersburg, Brown was visited by Frederick Douglass whom Brown unsuccessfully tried to recruit for the attack."

This charcoal-fired iron furnace complex employed free persons of African descent and also served as a station along one of the state's well-traveled corridors of the UGRR. In the early 20th century, Hiram E. Wertz publicly described his UGRR involvement with Steven's superintendent at Caledonia Furnace, William Hammett, and businessman Robert Black III. A resident and shopkeeper in the Village of Greenwood, two miles west of Caledonia, Black aided residents of the nearby enclave called \"Africa\", just south of his properties in Greenwood on US Route 30. Here, Wertz turned over freedom seekers he led by night from his family farm eight miles south in the Village of Quincy. In late June of 1863, Confederate troops destroyed Caledonia Iron Works on their way to Gettysburg, in part because Stevens' ownership of the works and his anti-slavery efforts."

    "ABSTRACT":"Leonard Black (8 March 1820-28 April 1883) is the author of the slave narrative, \"The Life and Sufferings of Leonard Black a Fugitive from Slavery\" (1847). He was born enslaved in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. This narrative recounts his escape in 1837. After his arrival in the North, he became interested in the ministry and involved with George H. Black, a Baptist minister, whose daughter he married. Black attended theological school with assistance from the president of Brown University and possibly with the proceeds of his narrative. Toward the end of his life, Black moved to Virginia where in 1873 he was made pastor of the First Baptist Church, also know as Harrison Street Church, in Petersburg. He was successful in doubling the church's membership during his time there. Black's death on April 28, 1883 was followed by one of the largest funerals ever held in the city. More than five thousand people overflowed the church service and lined the streets to the cemetery. In the following months funds were raised for a stone monument with a bas-relief portrait to mark Black's burial site in the African-American cemetery now known as People's Memorial Cemetery."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Washington, D.C. [DC], building at Judiciary Square is associated with the Underground Railroad as the site of the trials of Daniel Drayton and Edward Sayres, captains of the ship The Pearl, in which over 70 freedom seekers attempted to escape from enslavement in the DC area in 1848. Both captains were convicted and sent to prison. Many freedom seekers were sold to slave traders. The history of this attempted escape and of the captains' and freedom seekers' fate is known, thanks to period newspapers, Harriet Beecher Stowe, and memoirs of one of the captains and one of the lawyers, Horace Mann. Secondarily, City Hall is the only place associated with compensated emancipation in the United States. The act of emancipation for DC bondsmen, passed by Congress on April 16, 1862, occurred before the Emancipation Proclamation in January 1863. The records of the administration of the compensation provide valuable details on those who were emancipated."

It may be the earliest known site associated with slaves seeking freedom by escape and living in communitis where they were free. Spanish Florida became a 17th and 18th century refuge for slaves seeking freedom. The site of Fort Mose is a tangible remanant of early attempts by African Americans to gain their freedom. The fact that it was a community of free African Americans makes it even more significant."

Oswell Wright, a free African American living in Corydon, IN and David and Charles Bell, white farmers living on the Indiana side of the Ohio River were arrested by KY officials for helping with Woodford's escape. The Bells' relative broke into the local KY jail and freed David and Charles, who escaped further prosecution. Only Oswell Wright was brought to court and convicted ofhelping Charles. Wright was sentenced to five years in the KY Penitentiary for his role. Upon release, he returned to live in Corydon, IN where he died in 1875. Charles' escape and the arrest of those who helped him created such a furor that it came to be widely known as the Bell-Wright Case or the \"Brandenburg Incident.\""

    "ABSTRACT":"Anti-slavery Quakers and free people of color from the surrounding pre-Civil War African American settlements, in Indiana and Ohio, founded the Union Literary Institute (ULI). This school was one of the first schools of higher education established for Negro's in the nation. It was a manual labor school, which allowed the students to pay for their education by working on nearby farms. The significance of ULI to the UGRR is that the founding fathers of this school, both black and white were active participants in the UGRR in Indiana and Ohio. The site was a stopping point for many escaped slaves. This school not only symbolized the ducation of blacks but also educated many escaped slaves whom later went on to Canada to form their own communities."

The home, a station on the Underground Railroad, was often visited by John Brown and other conductors. One of these visits was during John Brown's \"Last Trek through Kansas.\" Brown's party which included 13 freedom seekers he had helped liberate out of Missouri stopped at the Owens House for meal and a safe place to rest. The Owens House was the last stop before Brown would engage in the infamous \"Battle of the Spurs,\" in which the party was attacked by pro-slavery men attempting to end their journey to freedom.\n\n"

    "ABSTRACT":"Over more than two centuries, the Massachusetts Historical Society has amassed more than 3,500 collections of personal, family, and institutional papers, including more than 2,200 diaries together with supporting collections of books, pamphlets, maps, newspapers, photographers, and artifacts-an essential source for the study of early America that places the story of the Underground Railroad in historical context. Founded in 1791, only a few years after the end of slavery in Massachusetts, the MHS collected and preserved contemporary materials-broadsides, flyers, pamphlets, and especially manuscript records of the lives of individuals, families, and organizations throughout the Antebellum period. Two online collections are of great interest to the Underground Railroad Network: African Americans and the End of Slavery in Massachusetts and Images of the Antislavey Movement in Massachusetts."

Hayden was about to release them to two Virginia slave-catchers, but white abolitionists Spencer Kellogg and Alvan Stewart argued that the captives deserved a legal hearing. Judge Hayden agreed and ordered the slave-catchers and the fugitives to remain in a back room of his office building until his return from duties at the county courthouse. During Hayden's absence from his office, a crowd gathered around the building, many of whom were African Americans, broke into the office and freed the two men."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Julius LeMoyne House is significant as a National Historic Landmark for its association with the antebellum, anti-slavery movement as a center of anti-slavery activity and a safe station on the Underground Railroad. The period of significance begins with Julius LeMoyne's entry into the Washington Anti-Slavery Society in 1834 and ends with the ratification of the 13th Amendment in 1865. Through the 1830's and 1840's Julius threw himself into the anti-slavery cause. Using his position as a prominent community figure, he and his wife made their house a center of anti-slavery activity in southwestern Pennsylvania. When Julius joined the anti-slavery cause he did not limit his commitment to politics, organizing rallies, and debating the constitutional abstractions of states' rights, property rights, and human rights. Like many Americans and some of his neighbors his conscience prompted him to bend the law by aiding the escape of fugitive slaves. He put himself at risk by offering his house as a safe station on the fugitive slave escape network."

    "ABSTRACT":"Riverview Farm, a farm of about 284 acres in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, was the location that set the ardently anti-slavery course of the life of young Thomas Garret, Jr. who became one of the most important links in the network of Underground Railroad operatives in the Delaware Valley. At his parent's farm, Riverview was where he came face to face with the tenuous existence of African Americans living under the oppresive slave system when a free African-American woman in the employ of the household was kidnapped to be sold into slavery. His participation in her rescue set him on a path to actively change the slave system by assisting over 2,700 individuals seeking freedom through the Underground Railroad from his base in Delaware. At the death of their father in 1839, Riverview Farm developed as stations on the Underground Railroad during the tenure of Thomas Garrett's brothers Isaac Price Garrett and Edward Garrett who inherited Riverview Farm and split it into two farms, Cleveland Farm owned by Edward Garrett and Fernland Farm owned by Isaac Price Garrett. Two other Garrett brothers Philip living with Edward and Samuel were also active on the Underground Railroad in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania. (Riverview Farm is now part of Arlington Cemetery)"

    "ABSTRACT":"Between 1842 and 1862, Aquia Landing of Stafford, Virginia was a pivotal gateway between southern states and northern ports. As the terminus of the Richmond Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad, Aquia Landing was the only direct rail-to-steamboat transfer point on the Potomac River between the capital cities of Richmond, VA and Washington, DC. Here, passengers, cargo and entire rail cars were transferred from the RFP Railroad to steamboat vessels which carried them from the Aquia Creek up the Potomac River to Washington, DC and Baltimore, MD. This key location also positioned Aquia Landing as a major gateway along the Network to Freedom through which fugitive slaves had to pass in order to reach freedom. This wharf helped transport prominent individuals such as William and Ellen Craft in December 1848 and Henry \"Box\" Brown in March 1849, and also aided an estimated 10,000 freedom seekers who sought refuge behind Union lines during the first Federal occupation to Stafford County between April and September 1862. These documented escapes occured prior to the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation of September 22, 1862."

The NAEI admitted self-emancipated slaves as members. David Ruggles, an active UGRR agent in NYC in the 1830s, was a member of the NAEI, as was Sojourner Truth. The archives include materials documenting the UGRR activity of evangelical abolitionists and Liberty and Free Soil partisans. The NAEI sold property to evangelical fugitive assistant J. P. Williston. At his Greenville Manufacturing Company he provided work for fugitive slaves. Through his efforts and the multiracial attitudes fostered by the NAEI, Florence became ten percent African American by 1850. The David Ruggles Center library includes books on UGRR and Abolition from along the Connecticut River. Exhibits of high quality reproductions of documents describe individuals and movements of the era through cooperative relationships with facilities such as the Sophia Smith Collection and Historic Northampton.\n\n<div>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n</div>\n\n<div>Open to the public by appointment.</div>"

RPL-LHD opened and provided a professionally researched and designed permanent online exhibit in September 2007 entitled, \"Many Roads to Freedom\". Both the broad context and particular stories of local Underground Railroad actions are shown in digitized copies of primary source documents, period graphics, local newspapers which deal with the subject, and various items used for teaching document based questions in the NY state social studies curriculum. These include newspapers, speeches, abolitionist writings, songs, portraits, biographies, and a folio of abolitionist manuscript items. This online exhibit has been presented to numerous groups of teachers by the division's staff, and also it has been presented to statewide conventions of libraries, historical agencies, and archivists. The RPL-LHD is now recognized as a de facto history center for the region, especially with the online availability of these materials. Other materials regarding the Underground Railroad collections include manuscript items relating to Frederick Douglass' life in Rochester, Frederick Douglass' newspapers ( both in microfilm and digital format), microfilmed copies of his scrapbooks, and one of a kind images of underground railroad stops."

    "ABSTRACT":"Mount Hope Cemetery in Rochester, NY is the final resting place of abolitionists and figures associated with the UGRR. Due to its location, waterways and close proximity to Canada, Rochester became a bustling hub of UGRR activity. Many fugitives were ushered through Rochester on the path to freedom, and some chose to make Rochester their home, including Reverend Thomas James, Georgiana Sims, Charlotte Bristol, and William Thomas. Austin Steward lived in Rochester for a time, leaving 3 infant children in the cemetery. Many citizens of Rochester operated stations, including George Avery, John Kedzie, Samuel Porter, Henry Quinby, David Richardson, David Stanley and the families of Asa Anthony, Daniel Anthony, Elias DeGarmo, Lester Dolley, Samuel D. Porter, and Issac Post. William Falls, Edward Williams and Jacob Morris helped the cause by soliciting funds to aid escaping slaves. Susan B. Anthony and Henry Selden were acquainted with John Brown, and aided the cause after the failed Harper's Ferry raid. Frederick Douglass belongs in any and all of these categories, as he spent a great portion of his adult life in Rochester, raising his family, publishing his paper, aiding fugitives and fighting the injustice of human bondage."

    "ABSTRACT":"Lake Champlain's Rouses Point's Pier was the most important station on the Champlain Line of the Underground Railroad which encompassed the geographical corridor between Albany and Troy and Canada's Richelieu River. Located a mile below the international border, the bustling 100 foot dock and train depot was a landing for Lake Champlain steamboats and trains from New York City and Boston. Self emancipated men, women and children continued north on trains to Montreal or by rail to Ogdensburg, New York, where steamboats took them to refugee settlements in Canada West. For example, Maryland runaway Charlotte Gilchrist entered Canada on a train from the Champlain Valley in 1854. Two years later, Vermonters helped a fugitive evade his former master and a U.S. marshall and put him on a freight train bound for Canada. A man identified only as \"Bill\" was forwarded from Massachusetts to Vermont in 1859 with a note that he was not to be sent through Rouses Point because he might be seen and captured. In the winter of 1861, Mrs. Lavinia Bell escaped from Texas to Rouses Point where a Canadian Underground Railroad agent paid her fare to Montreal. Thus, Rouses Point's Pier became a major transfer station where fugitives from slavery boarded trains for their final destinations in Upper and Lower Canada."

There, on August 19, 1859, discussions were held on the Abolitionist Brown's plans for the impending raid on the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry, Virginia. The ill-fated raid occurred on October 16, 1859. At the meeting, Brown tried unsuccessfully to enlist Douglass in his plans. The Cemetery, established circa 1850, also holds the remains of 26 African American veterans of the Civil War."

    "ABSTRACT":"Stories From Da Dirt is a living history dramatic presentation which was researched and written and by African American Studies professor, Dr. Nancy J. Dawson. The paly utilizes music, dance and storytelling to tell the story of African Americans (men and women) who went to Fort Donelson (Dover, TN) as laborers, cooks, nurses and soldiers. Specifically, the play focuses on several families who lived near the Fort who still have connections to the area. Several of the soldiers of the military from the 8th USCT enlisted at Fort Donelson as early as 1864. Some of the soldiers actually escaped from local farms and came to Fort Donelson to enlist. Much of the research gathered for the production is directly from pensions and military records obtained by Dr. Dawson at the National Archives in Washington, DC."

    "ABSTRACT":"Slavery existed in Alexandria, VA, since the city's origins, and ads in the Alexandria Gazette document generations of freedom seekers. Alexandria was also the site of a substantial population of free African Americans, as well as a thriving slave trade. During the Civil War, when Alexandria was occupied by federal forces, the city became a magnet for African Americans escaping from enslavement. The Alexandria Library, Special Collections Branch, collects books, journals, newspapers, microfilm, private papers, wills, deeds, tax records and dissertations dealing with the history and culture of Virginia and the Mid-Atlantic region, with a concentration on Northern Virginia. The branch is the repository for the historic records of the city of Alexandria. Published resources in the collection include memoirs, religious and civic histories, and genealogies. The archives holds many items unique to the history of Alexandria and Northern Virginia. The Collection also includes books and periodicals from every county in the state of VA. Recent budget reductions have forced the library to cut both staff and service hours. Despite these cuts, the library is able to successfully assist patrons with their researach. The branch remains the place to go for both scholarly research and general public inquiry regarding the Underground Railroad, African American history and the story of both in Alexandria."

    "ABSTRACT":"Located in Northern Virginia, Fairfax Co. has been intimately involved in the history of the US. Formed from Prince William Co. in 1742, colonial Fairfax Co. and its port town of Alexandria, Virginia, quickly became a center of commerce in the mid-Atlantic Region. George Washington and George Mason were 2 of the early luminaries who called Fairfax Co. home. The Historical Records Room holds the original, official records of the county and circuit court from 1742 up through the early 20th century. County courts in Virginia served as the primary local form of government until the Virginia Constitution of 1870 created the Board of Supervisors. The location of Fairfax Co., close to the federal government in Washington, DC, and the Chesapeake Bay, brought a variety of people and cultures together.Their shared experiences provided Fairfax with a rich and diverse history. The history of African-Americans in Fairfax Co. can be traced through these court records. Enslavedpeopleappear in the records as jailed runaways, values in estates, property in inventories, petititioners for freedom, defendants in criminal cases and missing valuables. Free African Americans also called Fairfax Co. home, establishing their own communities and participating in civic life."

It stands upon a hilltop by the mouth of Neabsco Creek and the Potomac River. The 18th-century plantation had its own port from which tobacco was exported and it was located on the well-traveled King's Highway (now Route 1). The main house and 40 surrounding acres belong to the PWC government. The site is significant to Underground Railroad history, because it was a plantation using enslaved laborsomeofwhomescapedwhile belonging to the Blackburn family (1733-1820) and the Atkinson families (1820-1920).\n\nHistorical documents verify that people enslaved at Rippon Lodge escaped during Thomas Blackburn's tenure. An 1804 newspaper notice for information regarding a freedom seeker named Rachel is signed \"from the subscriber...T. Blackburn, Rippon Lodge near Dumfries.\""

    "ABSTRACT":"The overriding theme of the program, African Americans: From Slavery to Emancipation, is the quest for freedom by enslaved African Americans, the struggles that they endured and the steps they took to achieve liberty and equality. The Underground Railroad was an important means of obtaining freedom for many, and it is highlighted in this program along with the story of Harriet Tubman, the most famous conductor of the Underground Railroad, who repeatedly risked her life and became the Moses of her people. The program, geared toward 4th and 5th graders, begins with introductory information on slavery, which helps set the stage for students in understanding the importance of the Underground Railroad as a means of obtaining freedom. By utilizing a handling collection that makes history tangible, this program is a valuable tool for teachers seeking to reinforce Virginia Standards of Learning related to slavery, the Underground Railroad, and the American Civil War. While acknowledging the horrors of slavery, the program tells the story of African Americans and their struggles to obtain freedom and equality not only for themselves but also for their race as a whole."

    "ABSTRACT":"For four centuries African Americans have shaped the state's history, and their lives and stories are preserved in the Virginia Historical Society. The VHS is the largest repository of non-official manuscripts in the commonwealth, and the collection of personal, family, and corporate papers ranges from the colonial period to the present. These unique materials are supplemented by an extensive collection of books, journals, newspapers, maps, sheet music, broadsides, and museum artifacts. Since 1831, the VHS has acquired materials that relate to various aspects of African American life in Virginia. Researchers have used these plantation records and family papers for evidence of fugitive slaves, slave rebellions, and other forms of resistance. Historians have produced numerous books and articles that include material from the VHS collections, and the long-term exhibit, The Story of Virginia, has extensive sections on the introduction and development of slavery. As a museum and research library, the VHS is a source for educational outreach and information on the reinterpretation of the African American experience from Jamestown in 1619 to the colonization movement, and from Jim Crow to the Civil Rights Movement. In the absence of extensive first-hand accounts by slaves, the Virginia Historical Society is an important center where a range of evidence can be studied to place the Underground Railroad in historical context"

    "ABSTRACT":"A Union force that included the First Kansas Colored Volunteer Infantry Regiment, consisting largely of former slaves, left Camden, Arkansas, on April 17, 1864, to gather food from the surrounding countryside. They camped along White Oak Creek and began their return to Camden the next day. Confederate cavalry blocked the road and ambushed the train at Poison Spring. Due to their reputation for fierce fighting, Colonel Williams positioned the 1st Kansas Colored Infantry to face the heaviest Confederate onslaught. They successfully repulsed two enemy attacks, but with heavy losses. Without reinforcements, they gave way on the third attack. The 1st Kansas suffered a high proportion of dead to wounded: 117 killed, 65 wounded. According to Colonel James M. Williams of the First Kansas Colored Infantry: \"The conduct of all troops was characterized by true soldierly bearing, and in no case was a line broken except by an overwhelming force, and then falling back only when so ordered. The gallant dead all (showed) the most heroic spirit, and died the death of true soldiers.\" The unstaffed commemorative state park is on the battle site and open daily. Six wayside exhibit panels tell the story of the Camden Expedition, a National Historic Landmark, and the Battle of Poison Spring.\n\n\n"

    "ABSTRACT":"The Camden Friends Meeting House is associated with the Underground Railroad as a site of regional Quaker worship that formed the hub of a network of individuals, connected by faith, family, and conviction, who assisted freedom seekers navigate the complex and dangerous Delaware landscape on their way north to Philadelphia and beyond. It is also the burial place of many of those individuals, both well known and lesser so. The most well known and well documented UGRR operative buried here was John Hunn (1819-1894), who with Thomas Garrett was prosecuted for assisting the Samuel Hawkins family as they traveled through Delaware in 1845. Long considered an important member of the Meeting, an undated bronze plaque was erected detailing his story in the Meeting House parking lot. Other members of the Meeting known for participation in the Underground Railroad include Jabez Jenkins, whose brick home on Main Street is a reputed stop on the Underground Railroad, and Ezekial Jenkins, whose connection to the Underground Railroad is documented in the escape of Samuel Hawkins in 1845 as the author of a letter in the possession of conductor Samuel D. Burris to Quakers in the Odessa/Middletown area who would provide aid."

The society operates the museum from May 1 though October of each year. it is open to the public each weekend from 1:00 to 6:00 p.m. on Saturdays from 1:00 to 5:00 p.m. on Sundays, holidays, and by special request for other times. The purpose of the museum is to preserve and interpret the history of the several extinct and extant villages and communities in the Clinton Lake vicinity. In 1854, the area around the museum, the Wakarusa Valley, was settled by many people who believed that slavery was wrong. This area is historically known as the home of the Bloomington Guards, the Underground Railroad where Quaker abolitionists provided a safe haven, and where many of both races served in the 1st Kansas Colored Volunteer Infantry Regiment."

    "ABSTRACT":"Darnall's Chance was opened to the public as a historic house museum in 1988 and is owned by the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission. The house was built in 1742 by James Wardrop, a Scottish immigrant, who amassed a fortune as a merchant and entrepreneur in the bustling 18th century port-town of Upper Marlborough, Maryland. Wardrop's 20-acre residential complex included a substantial brick dwelling house and outbuildings, orchards, livestock, and an ornamental garden. Throughout its history, the site has served as the town-home of many prominent tobacco merchants.\nDarnall's Chance is significant to Underground Railroad history because the site depended on the labor of enslaved African Americans for more than a century. Through runaway slave advertisements, historians have been able to identify eight enslaved individuals who ran away from Darnall's Chance. John Hodges who owned Darnall's Chance from 1799 until 1825 placed two runaway slave advertisements for a man named William and his wife Nancy who ran away from Darnall's Chance in 1820. Horatio Scott who owned the house from 1832 until 1857 placed fourteen advertisements in the local newspapers calling for the capture of five individuals who ran away from Darnall's Chance: Basil Duppin, Leander, Camilla Dent, Louisa and John Dent. Mr. Edward Grafton Washington Hall who purchased the house from his father-in-law Horatio Scott owned Darnall's Chance from 1857 until 1899. He, too, placed an advertisement for the return of John Kettle in 1860."

    "ABSTRACT":"Since the 17th century, historians, surveyors, and newspaper ads have identified the swamp and canal as a refuge and a route to freedom for thousands of runaway enslaved Africans. For some, the swamp offered a means to purchase their freedom, through work on the Swamp Canal and in cedar and cypress shingle and timber production. Others found refuge deep within the swamp, living off the land and what they could steal. These 'outlyers' established maroon communities on the higher points of the swamp. Many lived here, raised families, and died here. For others, the swamp was a 'stopping point' to get to Norfolk or Portsmouth, VA, or to the Albemarle Sound and Elizabeth City, NC, where they could secure passage on a ship traveling north. Despite the method or living conditions, the swamp provided the means of freedom which so many sought. During the Civil War, Union regiments of the United States Colored Troops under the leadership of Brigadier General Augustus E. Wild successfully marched down the Swamp Canal bank to liberate and recruit enslaved Africans in NC."

    "ABSTRACT":"Federal officials at the New London Custom House collected tariffs and enforced laws, including the 1850 Fugitive Slave Law. It was the site of two Underground Railroad events. In August 1839, the Cuban cargo schooner \"Amistad\" was seized in Long Island Sound while carrying illegally enslaved West Africans. Federal officials towed the \"Amistad\" to the Custom House wharf to investigate and interview those onboard. There, a local abolitionist discovered the Africans were free-born, not legal slaves; his outcry led to the famous Supreme Court trial. The schooner remained in New London until 1840 when it was sold and its cargo auctioned-off at the Customs House. In September 1858, freedom-seeker Benjamin Jones reached New London after stowing away on a lumber schooner. He was brought to the Custom House and arrested by the federal agent. Local activists went there to protest. When asked, \"Do you want to be slave or free?\" Jones replied \"Free\" and was released. The Custom House is now a museum that promotes and interprets the maritime history of the port of New London and the surrounding region. The \"Amistad\" and Benjamin Jones stories are publicly told through the museum's exhibits, and programs."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Joseph Story House, 26 Winter Street, Salem, Massachusetts, is significant to the history of the Underground Railroad. This home was built for Joseph Story in 1811, the same year Story was appointed to the United States Supreme Court by President James Madison. Story spoke out forcefully and passionately, on and off the bench, against slavery and the slave trade as a moral and political evil.\n\nIn the pivotal case of the \"U.S. v. The Amistad\", Story ruled for the majority in 1841. By considering the slaves to be kidnapped Africans, illegally detained and restrained, Justice Story held they were not considered as pirates or the lawful property of a slaveholder. Because the slaves had been illegally seized and transported, their actions to regain their freedom by taking control of the ship were justified as self-defense in spite of the resulting death of the captain. Justice Story ordered the Africans to be freed and allowed to return to their homeland.\n\nJustice Story's later 1822 decision in the complex case of the \"U.S. v. La Jeune Eugenie\", upheld the 1808 law forbidding U.S ships and citizens from importing slaves and went on to order the slaves to be freed."

Captain John Lowry's famous safe house, a quater-mile northwest of Lodi Cemetery, burned down in the 1900s and a subdivision masks the significance of the historic site. Captain Lowry publicly declared his hatred of slavery and promoted his farm as a place of safety. Lowry participated in a network helping people escape to Canada."

    "ABSTRACT":"Broderick Park was the location of the Black Rock Ferry, a major transporation link across Niagara River between Buffalo, NY and Fort Erie, Canada. The ferry operated continuously from the Broderick Park location from 1825 until the service was discontinued in the middle of the 20th century. Buffalo's destiny as important national transporation hub was sealed when it was chosen for the terminus of the Erie Canal in the 1820s. The dock where the ferry landed and departed for nearby Cananda was used as an UGRR station from at least the 1830s until the Civil War."

The home was also the site of many meetings to plan the anti-slavery convention held in Syracuse in 1854. Mr. Barnes and another activist, Mr. Charles Sedgwick, contributed bail money for those indicted as a result of the Jerry Rescue that took place in the city. George Barnes along with others, signed bail for $2000 each for a group who helped with the Rescue and signed bail for another $4000 for William Thompson, an African American. Sedgwick served as their legal counsel.\nIn March of 1854 he signed a call for a meeting to support the rescue of a freedom seeker in Milwaukee, WI. In April of 1854 he was one of the Directors of a newly formed City Anti-Slavery Society.The home was visited many times by such notables as Samuel May who married George and Rebecca. May was involved with Underground Railroad activities in Massachusetts."

    "ABSTRACT":"The 70-mile segment of operating passenger railroad line between Philadelphia and the City of Lancaster, PA was part of the original, 80-mile Philadelphia, Columbia Railroad, one of the earliest railroad rights of way in the nation, beginning operations in 1834. This pioneering railroad was the eastern-most segment of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's statewide, 390-mile-long Main Line of Public Works. By the late 1830s, this same eastern segment also became one of the most secretive and expeditious transportation corridors for formerly enslaved people to reach freedom in the care of the Vigilance Committee in the City of Philadelphia. African American entrepreneurs William Whipper and Stephen Smith of Columbia owned and operated railroad box cars which were routinely used to transport freight from their successful businesses to and from Philadelphia. Some of these box cars, according to Whipper and other credible sources, were peculiarly constructed with hidden compartments for carrying freight belonging to the Underground Railroad. One account states that no freedom seekers were ever detected using this transport system. Columbia's burgeoning industrial riverfront on the Susquehanna provided employment for large numbers of African Americans as early as circa 1820. This community emerged as a magnet for freedom seekers and humanitarians supporting the anti-slavery cause. Slave catchers were also a constant threat during these years. One abolitionist, William Wright, a Quaker, is widely credited with organizing the system of overland transport of freedom seekers from one Friends' family home or farm to another, a distance of about 10 miles apart, or the distance one could travel overnight by foot or wagon. Together, these factors support the popular anecdotal notion of Columbia as one of the unique places where the movement emerged that became known as the Underground Railroad."

    "ABSTRACT":"Mary Ann (Day) Brown (1816-1884)was more than a 19th century farmer's wife; she was freedom fighter John Brown's partner and confidant in direct action toward the abolition of slavery. Although her gravestone reads \"wife of John Brown of Harpers Ferry\", Mary A. Brown should be remembered for her personal sacrifices and contributions to the Underground Railroad movement and the abolition of slavery in the United States. The Brown family homes in Springfield, Massachusetts and North Elba, New York were used to shelter freedom seekers. Those who heard of John Brown' support found direct, practical and sympathetic assistance, whether he was at home or away. Mary was active in assisting freedom seekers who were directed to her home, sharing limited family resources, and the risk of possible persecution and prosecution for involvement with her husband's illegal activities. Mary and her family suffered poverty and hardship as a result of John Brown's frequent absences from home. Food and money were in short supply and sickness and death were a part of her life. In 1963, researcher Dr. Clarence Gee of Lockport, NY told wrote the following to \"Kansas City Times\" writer Velma West Sykes, \"It is all true, the hardships she endured, that you have found in your research. But in nothing she ever said or in any of her actions is there any criticism expressed about her husband for the privations suffered by her and her family.\"\n\nIn 1839, Mary and the older Brown children took an oath of secrecy and commitment to fight against slavery. As she told abolitionist friends in November, 1859, while making her way to Virginia to see her husband before his hanging on December 2: \"He had been waiting twenty years for some opportunity to free the slaves; we had all been waiting with him the proper time when he should put his resolve into action.\" Mary's sons, Oliver and Watson, were killed during this raid. Mary Brown was associated with notable figures of the Underground Railroad movement,"

    "ABSTRACT":"The antebellum-era town of Halifax, NC, was a major destination for freedom seekers. Although the Roanoke River was clearly an UGRR waterway route, the river is not the only reason for escape activity to and from Halifax. Halifax had one of the largest free Black communities in North Carolina, had a large skilled class of enslaved artisans, and existed in close proximity to an actively, abolitionist Quaker population. Based on the number of runaway slave ads indicating the town of Halifax as a final destination, one can conclude that Halifax provided a safe refuge for freedom seekers. Approximately 59 runaway slave advertisements from 1791 to 1840 were posted for 70 freedom seekers running to the town of Halifax. Slave owners specified in the runaway ads that slaves ran to the town of Halifax for several reasons, as listed: having a trade, being known in Halifax; attempting to pass as free; visiting a friend or relative; being hidden by someone in Halifax; having been caught once before in Halifax; etc. The UGRR in Halifax clearly represents the confluence of many communities, slave and free, along with the geographic identifiers of Halifax's border river, the Roanoke."

This additional recognition and branding of unique UGRR Network to Freedom sites within the corridor will tie them to a larger Erie Canalway Network and provide a network of interpretive opportunities for the cultural and heritage traveler.The story of the UGRR is intimately tied to the Erie Canalway. While the Canalway is well known as a transportation marvel of the 1800s and for the ecomonic growth it brought to New York, it also served as a critical mode of transportation for people and ideas, including the integral role as a pathway or destination for freedom seekers."

    "ABSTRACT":"The United States Colored Troops Institute for Local History and Family Research (USCTI) was established at Hartwick College in 1998 as an educational membership organization to promote and encourage research, preservation, and remembrance about the United States Colored Troops,(USCT) inclusive of men of African descent, Native Americans, and their white officers. Since more than 80 percent of the USCT were formally enslaved at the time of their enlistment, flight to freedom was certainly a reality for many of them. The Institute is devoted to placing the USCT within the historical realm of the Underground Railroad. The USCTI assists multiple researchers ranging from individual families, preservation organizations, Underground Railroad sites, and the media. It has been honored with proclamations from several state governments and the Congressional Black Caucus Veterans Braintrust, as well as entered into the Congressional Record for outstanding historical and genealogical research. Most significant about the USCTI is that its work is supported by the privately owned Matthews Collection for the Preservation of Freedom Journey Classics. It comprises 2,500 items, including books about persons whose flight to freedom helped to energize the Underground Railroad, as well as a lithograph series by Civil War illustrator Thomas Nast. The USCTI at Hartwick College was selected in 2008 as an endorsed site of the United States Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Harriet Beecher Stowe House was the hone of the Beecher family from the 1830s to 1850. Lyman Beecher, a nationally renowned minister, was the first president of Lane Theological Seminary and was supportive of anti-slavery measures. His daughter, Harriet, who came to Cincinnati with her family to live and teach, heard many stories about the UGRR from abolitionists like Rev. John Rankin, John Van Zandt, and Levi Coffin. She was living in Cincinnati when mobs attached and detroyed the anti-slavery printing press of James Birney, and she was influenced by activist students at Lane Seminary and local abolitionist leaders William Lloyd Garrison and Salmon P. Chase who litigated many fugitive slave cases. At one point, she helped her husband transport a fugitive slave along the UGRR north out of town. These and other experiences in Cincinnati inspired her to write her famous and controversial novel, Uncle Tom's Cabin, which described the UGRR in sharper, more personal terms than ever before and exposed slavery's evils to an audience who had previously been unaware or unwilling to acknowledge the atrocities inflicted by this \"peculiar institution.\""

Bishop Hanby was outspoken about his dislike of the Fugitive Slave Act and was involved with the UGRR for 20 years before mving his family to Westerville. Here, Hanby joined with other abolitionists, turning the hayloft in his barn into a station for escaping slaves. Son Benjamin assisted in these efforts and was inspired to write \"Darling Nelly Gray,\" a haunting song telling the true story of an escaped slave who died trying to reach Canada and earn money to purchase the freedom of his sweetheart, Nelly Gray. Popular before the Civil War, it stirred anti-slavery sentiment and was referred to as the \"Uncle Tom's Cabin of Song.\" It was sung around campfires on both sides of the war, Confederates revising the words."

    "ABSTRACT":"The limestone structure on 215 West Washington Row in Sandusky, Ohio served as the home and office for a number of years for Lucas Selkirk Beecher (1798-1882), an attorney who eagerly represented both apprehended freedom seekers and men accused of violating fugitive slave acts for assisting them in their escapes. Built between 1847 and 1848 on Washington Row in Sandusky, Ohio, this Greek Revival house is all that remains of the expansive estate that once served as both the home and the law office for Beecher until his death. Although Beecher was a partner with several other attorneys, this is the only structure which remains from where he practiced law.    In 1828, at thirty years of age, the native New Englander moved to Sandusky. Around 1834 he defended African America barber Grant Ritchie, an active Underground Railroad agent, for his role in assisting freedom seekers in their escape to Canada. F. D. Parish served as attorney for the prosecution. About that time Beecher represented freedom seeker Benjamin Johnson with Parish again representing the claimant. By 1845 Beecher found himself no longer on the opposite of the aisle with Parish, who had transformed into a strong antislavery proponent, and by breaking the 1793 Fugitive Slave Act by harboring and aiding in the escape of Jane Garrison and her son. \"Beecher's identification with the anti-slavery movement marked him as a man who preferred principle to profit and who had the courage to profess and advocate a great moral truth. The structure, listed on National register for historic homes, is well maintained and currently serves as office space and not open to the public."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Allegheny Portage Railroad and Main Line were part of the Pennsylvania Main Line of Public Works, a state-run transportation system connecting Philadelphia and Pittsburgh from the 1830s to 1850s. This system, usually just called the \"Main Line\", was a combination of canals, railroads, and inclined planes that moved passengers and cargo across the state. From 1834 when the system opened in its entirety until 1854 when the Pennsylvania Railroad opened, the Main Line was the primary east-west transportation route in Pennsylvania. The 36-mile stretch of the Main Line between Hollidaysburg and Johnstown known as the Allegheny Portage Railroad was also used by people escaping slavey as a transportation route. This application will cover Underground Railroad activities in both Johnstown and Hollidaysburg and will discuss how the Allegheny Portage Railroad linked the two.\n\nAllegheny Portage Railroad National Historic Site is a unit of the National Park Service and was authorized by Congress in 1964 to preserve the history of the Allegheny Portage Railroad and its part in the Main Line."

    "ABSTRACT":"About two miles south of Gettysburg, PA and 6 miles north of the Mason-Dixon Line, McAllister's Mill provided shelter to hundreds of freedom seekers during the years leading up to the Civil War, including some delivered to the site by nationally-recognized Underground Railroad conductor, William L. Chaplin. After receiving assistance at the late 18th century grist mill, the formerly enslaved were guided north about 10 miles to the homes of free African Americans and Quaker Abolitionists, forming critical links in one of the earliest regional networks of the Underground Railroad in the nation. Milling operations ceased at the site in the 19th century. The property now includes remnants of the mill building and related mill structures, all set amid large boulders that line Rock Creek in a densely-wooded area where the mill once stood.\n\nOn July 4, 1836, McAllister'sMill was the site of an early and significant gathering of Abolitioniss in Pennsylvania.\n\nChaired by mill owner and farmer James McAllister, Jr., the group agreed to publish bold anti-slavery principles, which were reportedly ghost-written by Gettysburg attorney and  later U.S. Congressman Thaddeus Stevens. This meeting led to the formation of the Adams County Anti-Slavery Society within six months."

    "ABSTRACT":"On August 23, 1848, at his property at 45-47 South Queen Street, attorney Thaddeus Stevens (1792-1868) assisted several freedom seekers from Maryland, guiding the group seven miles east to the next Underground Railroad outpost, the farm of Daniel and Hannah Gibbons at the Village of Bird-in-Hand.\n\nThe previous year, 1847, while he was a well-known attorney at this location, Stevens paid agents to infiltrate the ranks of slave catchers operating in Lancaster County. He thwarted their plans by alerting Underground Railroad activists before the bounty hunters arrived to capture their targets.\n\nAlso in the 1840s and 1850s, Stevens' Caledonia Iron Works in Franklin County, PA, provided employment and support for African Americans through the agency of his superintendent and other Underground Railroad operatives in Franklin and Adams Counties.\n\nAs Lancaster County's U.S. Congressman, Stevens served as co-counsel to defendants charged with treason in connection with the Christiana Resistance, which occurred on September 11, 1851.\n\nAs Lancaster Congressman, Stevens was an avowed Abolitionist and Constitutional scholar, playing key roles enacting major civil rights Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. The \"Old Commoner\" was one of the prime movers of Reconstruction and the leading advocate for the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson, whom he regarded as too lenient towards the rebellious South."

    "ABSTRACT":"Upon entering the John Brown House Museum, visitors are introduced to the \"Forgotten History: Rhode Island and the Slave Trade\" exhibit. In 1764, the one-hundred ton brigantine Sally embarked from Providence to West Africa on a slaving voyage. The ship was owned by the four brother firm of Nicholas Brown and Company. This voyage was one of roughly a thousand transatlantic slaving ventures launched by Rhode Islanders in the colonial and early national period, and one of the deadliest. Of the 196 Africans acquired by the ship's master, Esek Hopkins, at least 109 perished, some in a failed insurrection, others by suicide, starvation, and disease. The insurrection is documented in the exhibit and the account has been reproduced and enlarged from the original journal. Although unsuccessful, as most slave trading voyage uprisings were, this revolt demonstrates the African slaves' determination to acquire their freedom. The story of the brave and anonymous slaves onboard the Sally should be shared on a national level and connected to other accounts in the fight for freedom."

The Library holds The Elizabeth Buffum Chace (MSS 1002) Family Papers, which include materials concerning her involvement in the abolition movement and the Underground Railroad.\n\nThe printed collections include monograms, many of them unique, others rare and out of print, on the Underground Railroad in Rhode Island.\n\nAltogether the Society's holdings on slaves, abolition and the Underground Railroad comprise a significant body of resources documenting the history of the state's relationship to slavery."

As the final resting place of many of those associated with the Underground Railroad in Tabor, Iowa, the cemetery is perhaps the best place to commemorate the town's significance to this important history because in many cases it remains the only tangible site that can be associated with those who were involved.1 The Underground Railroad activity of the people of Tabor, Iowa is well documented in reminiscences, correspondence, books, and in the Wilbur H. Siebert collection. These sources underscore that the involvement of this small town in Western Iowa was not just the result of individual efforts, but the community as a whole. As a result of their ties with Oberlin, Ohio and the Congregationalist Church, the settlers of Tabor were adamant in their beliefs of equal rights for all people regardless of race and sex and their participation in the Underground Railroad was an extension of these beliefs."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Sheldon Peck Homestead, a historic house museum located in Lombard, IL (formerly Babcock's Grove) is 20 miles west of downtown Chicago. Built in 1839, the house was home to Sheldon Peck, a nationally-known folk art painter, who was involved in the Underground Railroad. Peck's Underground Railroad activity was documented in a memoir kept by his youngest son Frank. It included accounts of Peck harboring Freedom Seekers on the Underground Railroad in the 1850s. Frank's memoir describes Old Charley, a Freedom Seeker who stopped at the Peck House. It also included lyrics to a slave spiritual song that Old Charley taught Frank. In addition, a painting by Sheldon's daughter Susan is believed to be of a Freedom Seeker that stopped at the Peck House.\n\nPeck was publicly considered a €¢radical abolitionist and had numerous friends and business associates involved in the Underground Railroad. In addition, several anti-slavery meetings were held at the Peck Homestead and Peck was an €¢agent for the \"Western Citizen\", an anti-slavery newspaper published in Chicago. Since 1999 the Peck Homestead has been a public museum and is operated by the Lombard Historical Society, a 501 (c)(3) not-for-profit."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Mt. Mitchell Heritage Prairie is a 45-acre tallgrass prairie preserve located in the Flint Hills of Kansas. The park was originally part of the Captain William Mitchell farm, which received Network to Freedom site designation in 2002 as a well-documented UGRR station. The prairie is located across the road from the Mitchell Farmstead, which is a private residence. Remnants of the Topeka Fort Riley Road, used by the UGRR, are visible in the park. In 1953 Mitchell's son, William I. Mitchell, gifted the property to the Kansas State Historical Society with the stipulation that it become a park memorializing his father and the Connecticut Kansas Colony, popularly known as the Beecher Bible and Rifle Colony. Many of the colonists participated in the UGRR. The historical society erected a monument to Mitchell and the colony but never developed the park. In 2006, a grassroots group, the Mt. Mitchell Prairie Guards facilitated the transfer of ownership to local control and began developing the property into the public park envisioned by W.I. Mitchell. The Mt. Mitchell Prairie Guards are working to make the park the primary educational venue for telling the story of the Kansas UGRR in the area."

    "ABSTRACT":"The house at 128 Mill Street in New Bedford, Massachusetts, was the home of Sergeant William H. Carney (1840-1908). Sergeant William H. Carney and his father, William H. Carney Sr., became the most well-known Norfolk fugitives in New Bedford. In 1857, William H. Carney Sr. escaped from Norfolk, Virginia and came to New Bedford. William H. Carney Jr. escaped to New Bedford in 1859. Here young Carney spent the greater part of the remainder of his life. On March 4, 1863, Carney, along with forty-six other blacks from New Bedford, enrolled in Company C of the Massachusetts 54th Regiment to take part in the Civil War. The Massachusetts 54th Regiment, instituted under Governor John A. Andrew in 1863, was the first black unit to be raised in the north. This regiment was shipped to South Carolina on May 18, 1863. Carney's action during the battle at Fort Wagner on July 18, 1863 earned him honorable recognition. He protected and displayed the flag throughout the battle after the standard bearer fell. When he returned the flag to the remaining members of his regiment he said: €œBoys I only did my duty, the old flag never touched the ground.€ On May 23, 1900, Sergeant William H. Carney was finally recognized. He became the first African American to receive the Medal of Honor for his heroism during the Union assault on Fort Wagner. After his honorable discharge on June 30, 1864 he returned to New Bedford. He lived in the house at 128 Mill Street from 1870 until his death in 1908. New Bedford honors the memory of Carney in preserving his house."

The plantation was owned by a series of planters, including John Brown and heirs (1774-1812), John Brookes (1835-1858), and Samuel Berry (1859-1871).  Africans and African-Americans lived and worked at Mount Calvert from the late seventeenth century through the early twentieth century.\n\nMount Calvert is linked with the Underground Railroad through runaway advertisements.  Owner Samuel Berry placed at least two advertisements in local newspapers during April of 1860 calling for the return of \"Dick\" and \"Charles Sprigg\".  Another advertisement was placed by an earlier owner John Brookes for his house servants \"Susan\" and \"Arianna\" who ran away during 1841."

It is located six miles south and three miles east of Nebraska City in Otoe County. Camp Creek Cemetery was founded in 1866, when a pioneer of the area, George F. Lee, donated one acre of land for its creation. The cemetery was named Camp Creek Cemetery after the stream that ran nearby. Barbara Mayhew Bradway was the sister of John H. Kagi, a vital part of the Underground Railroad in Nebraska. John Kagi was John Brown's trusted friend and was a part of the famous raid on Harper's Ferry. It is well documented that Barbara Bradway and her first husband, Allen Mayhew, assisted John Kagi and John Brown when they were transporting twelve African Americans along the Underground Railroad. The Mayhews provided refuge and food to the freedom seekers at their cabin in Nebraska City, which is currently listed on the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom and the National Register of Historic Places."

    "ABSTRACT":"In a first-person costumed portrayal, the story of Barbara Ann Kagey Mayhew Bradway's life as an early settler of the Nebraska Territory is told. Many of the vexing issues of the day are recalled, such as slavery, the disputed route of the transcontinental railroad, and Nebraska statehood, as viewed through the lens of one of the first female settlers in the Nebraska Territory. Her story has numerous references to the issue of the Underground Railroad in the Territory. Specifically the program includes why the Kansas-Nebraska Act was so controversial, particularly its provision for the use of popular sovereignty with regards to the slavery issue. More personal topics that are explained in this program include Barbara's interactions with her brother, John Kagi (John opted to spell his last name in a more phonetically manner), who was John Brown's \"second in command,\" John Kagi's death at Harper's Ferry, and the role that the Mayhew Cabin, including Barbara herself, played in the effort to aide fugitive slaves coming up from the Kansas Territory. Finally the program explains how the issue of slavery impacted the transition of Nebraska from a territory to a state, all from a female settler's perspective .The program is part of the Nebraska Humanities Council's Speakers Bureau."

    "ABSTRACT":"The site of the Nuckolls residence in Nebraska City, Nebraska was the site of the escape of Eliza Grayson and Celia. Despite the prohibition of slavery in the Nebraska Territory, Stephen F. Nuckolls, originally from Grayson County, Virginia, brought his family and five slaves to the territory in early 1854 from Atchison County, Missouri. He had ambitious plans for the land and drove the first stake that established Nebraska City on July 10, 1854. As a leader in Nebraska City, Nuckolls had one of the first homes constructed on the corner of 5th and Main Street in Nebraska City, Nebraska. Eventually the Nuckolls residence was torn down and is now the site of a U.S. Postal Office.\n\nThe Nuckolls home is significant to the Underground Railroad because on November 26, 1858 Eliza Grayson and Celia, two of Nuckolls' five remaining slaves, escaped to freedom. Celia and Eliza were encouraged to escape by John Williamson who led them across the Missouri River into Civil Bend, Iowa. From there the women moved through Iowa on the way to Chicago. In pursuit, Nuckolls followed Eliza to Chicago and, with the help of local abolitionists; Eliza evaded her former master and acquired her freedom. Specific information regarding Celia's fate is unknown. By the year 1860, all of the people enslaved on the Nuckolls'property had successfully escaped from Nebraska City."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Union Township Public Library, est. 1915, has a unique collection of materials both published and unpublished geared towards illustrating the importance of Ripley, Ohio and surrounding areas in the Underground Railroad (UGRR) movement. The library's mission is to provide access to materials ranging from letters and unpublished manuscripts to modern publications on the UGRR history. From a fragile notebook listing contributors that financially assisted in the defense of John B. Mahan's 1838 felony trial to a 2011 publication of \"Grape Vine Dispatch: The Voice of Antislavery Messages\" by Caroline Miller, the collection attempts to provide researchers with both broad and detailed views of this area's history of UGRR participants and activities. The newspaper collection contains runs of local papers from 1821-1865 that give excellent accounts of local UGRR activity and abolitionist points of view. Our local history collection brings to one location many of the diverse resources that researchers require when studying Ohio and Kentucky UGRR participation. In the shadow of John Rankin's house, one of the prominent stations on the UGRR line, the library is primed to be the logical location for research materials, and has a director and board that actively support the continuing growth of the collection."

The road to the ferry Ellick traveled on before his escape remains as does the ferry landing.\nThe landscape is relevant to the Underground Railroad because of the escape from Conn's Ferry in 1817 of Ellick, an African-American worker enslaved by the\nfamily. While it is unknown if he used the ferry to escape, he made the most of an opportunity, caused by the confusion of being returned from jail to his owner, to run away again. Previously Ellick ran away after being arrested and punished for theft. When caught two months after that escape, he was imprisoned in the Leesburg, Virginia, jail overnight until his captors could take him back to his owner at the ferry.\n"

    "ABSTRACT":"Evergreen, in Prince William County, VA, is the manor house of a former plantation of over 1000 acres. The plantation belonged to a family well known in the county, a family known for three brothers and a son who joined the Confederate Army in the Civil War. It is now vacant. It is on the National Register for Historic Places. A community group is trying to save the building.\n\nThe plantation relates to the Underground Railroad because African American bondsmen escaped. In the 1850s Edmund Berkeley, from a distinguished Virginia family, was the plantation owner of Evergreen. According to the slave censuses of 1850 and 1860, Berkeley controlled his own bondsmen and those dower bondsmen from his wife. In 1850 he had 33 enslaved people. There are accounts of at least three escapes of Nelson, Bob, and White Bishop. The source for Bob and Nelson's escapes is Edmund Berkeley's 1852 \"Evergreen Farm Day Book\", and for White Bishop's escape, it is the \"Prince William Court Minute and Order Book.\""

From the 1600s, hundreds of runaway slaves from the plantations of the Carolinas endured the long, arduous journey to La Florida in search of freedom and opportunity for themselves and their families. Many settled at Fort Mose. For the escaped Africans residing at Fort Mose, the June 1740 battle constituted a urgent defense against the loss of their newly found freedom and their return to slavery.\n\nThis program uses first person interpretation and living history demonstrations to interpret the story of the residents of this historically significant site and their military defense against re-enslavement."

    "ABSTRACT":"In 2008, the Indiana Historical Bureau (IHB) erected a marker to commemorate the escape of Caroline at the Kingston Cemetery in Decatur County, Indiana. Caroline, a fugitive enslaved woman from Trimble County Kentucky, escaped with her four children (ages 2-12) on October 31, 1847, from George Ray. They crossed the Ohio River near Madison, IN (Jefferson County). They were conveyed via the Underground Railroad from there to Decatur County. While in Decatur County the family was recaptured by Woodson Clark, a pro-slavery resident of the area. But with the help of black and white abolitionists, the family escaped again and were helped further north through Underground Railroad stations in northern Decatur County, Rush, and Union Counties. After the escape, George Ray successfully brought a civil case against Luther Donnell, a member of the community who had assisted in the escape. According to William M. Hamilton's account, written many years later, Caroline and her children made it safely to Canada and wrote a letter to Luther Donnell, thanking him for his efforts.\n\n"

    "ABSTRACT":"The Honor Our Ancestors: the Freedom Seekers of Old Quindaro is an exhibit in the Old Quindaro Museum and Information Center which celebrates, documents and interprets Underground Railroad activity in Kansas and Missouri by highlighting the escape stories of former enslaved Africans who settled in Quindaro, a town located on the Missouri River established during the height of pre-Civil War debates. Quindaro was used as an ideological battleground for pro and anti slavery forces to determine whether the Kansas territory would come into statehood as a free-state. In the process of the debate, and well into the 20th century, formerly enslaved Africans migrated to Kansas, first as runaway slaves and later as Exodusters searching for freedom.\n\nThe museum, located in Wyandotte County, Kansas opened on September 12, 2008 under the auspices of the Concerned Citizens of Old Quindaro, a nonprofit organization. The museum is housed in a 19th century two-story-bungalow formerly owned by John Walker-- the grounds keeper for Western University (a now defunct African American university). Walker, who was instrumental in the installation of the famous John Brown statue, helped to preserve the area's African American history. The museum continues his work by preserving and disseminating the history of Quindaro through exhibits, lectures, tours and other programs.\n\n"

    "ABSTRACT":"Located in Leavenworth, Kansas, the \"first city of Kansas,\" is the site of the Planters Hotel a.k.a. Planter's House. In 1859, the hotel was the site of a kidnapping. Charles Fisher (a.k.a Peter Fisher), who worked at the hotel as a barber, was abducted from the hotel under suspicion of being a fugitive slave or being in violation of the fugitive slave act by assisting others in their escapes. After being arrested at gunpoint and handcuffed, Fisher who maintained he was free was taken into Missouri. Fisher, however, was able to escape and returned to Leavenworth. The two kidnappers were subsequently charged with kidnapping and brought to trial. Fisher was subpoenaed as a material witness despite prohibitions against blacks testifying against whites in court. Meanwhile, a man came forward claiming to be Fisher's owner and Fisher was detained in the custody of the Marshal at Planters Hotel. Fisher was able to escape with the help of free-state men, but was ultimately recaptured and sold into slavery. Fisher, however, once again found his way to freedom and returned to Leavenworth in 1863.\n\nThe Planters Hotel was torn down in the 1950s and the site, which is privately owned, is currently an empty lot. However, the City of Leavenworth has utilized its right away to put a marker and re-creation of the hotel steps, commemorating the hotel's existence, especially as it was related to Abraham Lincoln's 1859 visit.\n\n"

    "ABSTRACT":"On May 26, 2010, a ceremony was held at National Harmony Memorial Park in Landover, Maryland (MD), unveiling a memorial headstone marking the grave of Elizabeth Keckly. While Mrs. Keckly is best known as the seamstress/confidante of Mary Todd Lincoln and author of \"Behind the Scenes\", her largely forgotten work on behalf of the newly emancipated slaves deserves recognition. As the Civil War progressed, many of these former bondsmen, also known as contrabands, sought refuge in the nation's capital, often arriving with little more than the clothing on their backs.\n\nSome mistakenly believed the government would feed and clothe them as their former masters had done. Unfortunately, the government was slow to adopt a policy for helping the newly arrived freedmen, who were in desperate need of basic necessities. Elizabeth Keckly, realizing their plight, devoted herself to raising funds and collecting donations for their benefit. In 1862, she organized the Contraband Relief Association (CRA) at Union Bethel AME Church. Mrs. Keckly founded and served as the first president of the group of forty volunteers.\n\nThe CRA and similar societies helped expose the need for more government involvement in caring for the contrabands and helped set the standard for providing aid and sustenance to the former slaves.\n"

    "ABSTRACT":"Administered by the National Park Service, Fort Washington Park, the home of Fort Washington, is located south of  the District of Columbia (DC) in Prince George's County, Maryland. The fort exists to defend the nearby waterways and the adjacent Potomac River. Part of the landscape is the water nearby. Visible from Fort Washington, there is a site off Diggs Point at the mouth of Swann Creek relevant to the Underground Railroad. A mass escape of enslaved African Americans occurred in early September 1814. They escaped to a British ship moored there which had come down the Potomac River from occupied Alexandria, Virginia. Nearby, Fort Washington had just been blown up by the commander to avoid falling into the hands of the British.\n\nDuring the War of 1812 the British successfully attacked Washington. In order to undermine the local economy, a British Proclamation offered freedom to enslaved African Americans.  The escape of African Americans to the British near Fort Washington is documented by depositions sworn in the 1820s by plantation owners, from Prince George's County, seeking compensation from the British. None of the freedom seekers was recaptured. Of the group it is only known that at least one went to Nova Scotia and three to Bermuda.\n\n"

    "ABSTRACT":"In the late 1850s, African American Underground Railroad operators Millie and George McCoy lived on the Starkweather Farm in Ypsilanti. The McCoy cabin, no longer standing, was the couple's home upon their return to the United States. Sometime before 1839 with her emancipated husband, Millie escaped bondage in Louisville, Kentucky, traveling the Underground Railroad through Ohio eventually landing in Canada. In Colchester Ontario, the McCoys raised their children (including famed inventor Elijah McCoy), and in the late 1850s moved to the Starkweather farm and began operations on the Underground Railroad there. Underground Railroad networks from Ohio and western states intersected in Ypsilanti, then radiated out to crossing points along the Detroit River.\n\nThe evidence of the McCoys' Underground Railroad activities comes from daughter, Anna McCoy, fourth of twelve children. In an interview by Professor Mary Goddard of Eastern Michigan University (1913), Anna recalled specific names and incidents neither published, nor known. She remembered her mother cooking and sending the children to bed early and her father, George McCoy, departing with hidden cargo in his tobacco wagon. Though the McCoy's cabin is gone, the original 1844 Greek-Revival Starkweather house is a strong physical reminder of the farm during the period of the McCoys' residence and their Underground Railroad activities. The house is a stop on the Journey to Freedom Tour (NTF Program). Guides describe how Millie and George McCoy risked their freedom while helping others escape slavery."

    "ABSTRACT":"In 1998, Public Act 409 established the Michigan Freedom Trail Commission (MFTC) and directed it to preserve, protect and promote the legacy of the Underground Railroad in Michigan. In 2003, the Commission presented its mission: \"The Michigan Freedom Trail Commission encourages, coordinates and supports work that makes the history of the Underground Railroad a vital part of Michigan's civic discourse, its educational resources and its cultural tourism product.\" Commissioners, appointed by the Governor of Michigan, serve on committees within the organization to accomplish this mission. Over the past ten years, the MFTC has sponsored successful conferences, presentations, and research training. Across the state, citizens initiated archaeological digs, exhibits, lectures, and site and program listings. In 2011, the MFTC advised Adventure Cycling Association for a new tour, assisted the Charles Wright Museum in developing an online encyclopedia and helped fund an international Detroit River UGRR Conference. The Commission works within the state, regionally and nationally, and has a vibrant relationship with Canadian organizations to promote the legacy of the Underground Railroad in Michigan.\n\n"

    "ABSTRACT":"The Ypsilanti Historical Museum Fletcher-White Archives has a collection of published and unpublished materials that highlight the importance of Ypsilanti and southeast Michigan in the Underground Railroad. The Ypsilanti Historical Society, est. 1961, opened a museum and archives in a historic 1860 house that is a stop on the NTF-listed Underground Railroad (UGRR) \"Journey to Freedom Tours.\" In the museum's refurbished (elevator-accessible) basement, the Fletcher-White Archives offers general primary source materials such as historical maps, city directories and county atlases and dedicates half its file space to the Albert P. Marshall [Eastern Michigan University Professor] Black History Collection. The Archives' Family files house original letters, deeds, photographs and papers, including those of documented UGRR participants such as Aray, Preston and Harwood [see NPS Network to Freedom listed \"W. W. Harwood Farmstead, Saline\"]. The Archives strives to provide broad public access with a searchable online collections database; a University of Michigan partnership to digitize its 5,000 photographs; publication of quarterly newsletter \"The Gleanings,\" featuring historical articles and reminiscences; and links to historical and genealogical organizations.\n\n"

    "ABSTRACT":"Built in 1835, the brick Greek Revival Building in Zanesville, OH, is home to the Putnam Presbyterian Church. Although now part of Zanesville, the Church was the major religious center of the Putnam's abolitionist community. Its members actively supported the anti-slavery movement and the Underground Railroad. In fact it was the radical anti-slavery beliefs of the members that led to the church's founding. At one time, the members had attended the Zanesville Presbyterian Church, but when they found that their more radical anti-slavery beliefs were not embraced, they decided to start their own church.\nThe UGRR activity of other members is well documented in the Siebert Collection, county histories, and personal reminisces. Oral history indicates that the church might have been used to shelter freedom seekers, but so far this has not been corroborated.\n\nThe church, which still has an active congregation, was recognized for its involvement in the Underground Railroad on the National Register as part of the Putnam Historic District and by Ohio's Friends of Freedom Society."

    "ABSTRACT":"Enslaved residents who were members of the African Methodist Church, later known as Emanuel A.M.E. Church, escaped from Portsmouth aboard vessels that plied the waterways that headed to points north. These freedom seekers included Clarissa Davis and her two brothers William and Charles, and sister. Also, members such as Anthony Blow and Moses Wines were recorded to have escaped. Operatives like Henry \"Bluebeard\" Lewey and Eliza Bains, are credited with assisting many of the Church's members, especially in the 1840s and 50s. The Church's records indicated that their membership was depleted in the 1840s because of the large numbers who escaped. Moreover, other accounts, such as the book written by William Still and WPA oral histories of Portsmouth residents, discussed the interaction between the Church and the Underground Railroad."

    "ABSTRACT":"Fort Monroe, a Third System fortification built between 1819 and 1834, is located in Hampton, Virginia. The site, approximately 565 acres of ground, includes the 63-acre fortress and is a National Historic Landmark District and on November 1, 2011, portions were declared a National Monument.\nKnown also as \"\"Freedom Fortress,\" it was one of the few Union military installations in the South not occupied by Confederate forces during the Civil War. Perhaps its greatest historic significance is its association with the contraband decision by Fort Monroe commander General Benjamin Butler in May,\n1861. On May 23, slaves of Confederate Colonel Charles Mallory contracted out to work on nearby\nConfederate fortifications sought refuge at Fort Monroe. Butler refused to return them as stipulated in the\n1850 Fugitive Slave Act and declared them \"Contraband of War.\" More refugees soon arrived, overflowing space at the fortress for their shelter. The Grand Contraband Camp was constructed in the Confederate vacated and torched areas of Hampton to accommodate the Contraband and their families. Many of the Contraband were put to work at Fort Monroe in support of Union Army efforts. General Benjamin Butler's Headquarters where he weighed his options, made his decision, and initiated the Army's Contraband Policy is Old Quarters #1."

    "ABSTRACT":"Pen or Pencil„¢ Writing A New History uses mentor recruitment strategies developed by the National CARES MentoringMovement (NCMM) to apply and expand the classroom and experiential curriculum approach developed by the National Alliance of Faith and Justice (NAFJ) called Pen or Pencil„¢. Lessons from the Underground Railroad are translated into positive youth developmental constructs which form the basis for transformational behavior and resistance to today's enslaving variables. The founding core (national partners, individuals, organizations, agencies, etc.) comprise a well- organized but growing contemporary abolitionist movement who share the commitment to ensure youth necessary assistance to thrive, to embrace civic and other responsibilities, and apply goal-setting and resilience examples of those determined to be free. The interpretive history of mass engagement and youth leadership during the Civil Rights Movement is also used to mobilize, reach, teach, and inspire youngsters who struggle with the intense social, environmental, family, and school risks of today.\n\nConsistent with the NPS Underground Railroad Network to Freedom Initiative, the program aims to write a new history of ingenuity and build new appreciation for history through a network of assistance to resist or escape from enslavement (i.e. drugs, crime, violence, delinquency, truancy, etc.)."

    "ABSTRACT":"Thissiteisthe final resting place of Josiah Bushnell Grinnell (1821-1891), in Hazelwood Cemetery, Grinnell, Iowa. J. B. Grinnell, who began his career as a Congregational minister, was a passionate abolitionist from his youth, and an active participant in the Underground Railroad. The town which he founded in 1854 embodied Grinnell's commitment to abolition, and while J. B. usually obeyed the government, he was a conscientious breaker of the Fugitive Slave Law. He used his influence, his home, and wool barn to aid escaping slaves in their quest for freedom. Believing slavery to be evil, he welcomed the famous radical, John Brown to Grinnell in the winter of 1859 as he fled Kansas, bringing with him a party of guards and twelve fugitives. Humans and weapons were housed in Grinnell's home, his wool barn and a local hotel. None of these sites remain in existence. His home, located on Park Street, deteriorated, was moved to Broad Street and eventually torn down in 1984.Therefore, the Grinnell gravesite, situated on land he donated to the town, overlooking the community named for him, is the best place to commemorate his involvement in the Underground Railroad.\n\nHazelwood Cemetery is open to the public seven days a week during daylight hours."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Spanish colonial mission and fort known as Los Adaes served as both a destination and an Underground Railroad way station on an established route between French Louisiana and Spanish Texas. As such, it was under the jurisdiction of the Spanish Crown, which had begun to dismantle the institution of slavery in the region in the 1700s. Unfortunately, any prohibition on the use of enslaved labor was often ignored by the region's planters. However, at Los Adaes, cattle ranching and subsistence farming was the primary economic pursuit for the residents, thereby eliminating the need for enslaved laborers. As a borderland community, Adaes was not self-sufficient and residents engaged in trade for food with the French at Natchitoches. This led to an established path between the two countries, El Camino Real de los Tejas. Freedom seekers used the trade corridor to escape to Los Adaes and other parts of the Spanish interior. By the late 1700s, free people of African descent formed 15 percent of the population in Texas."

    "ABSTRACT":"The purpose of this application is to nominate the entire Chesapeake and Ohio(C,O) Canal National Historic Park for the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom.John Curry, a slave from North Carolina narrates his escape by following the towpath before passing into Pennsylvania.Franklin Blackford recounts in his diary the capture of five slaves along the towpath and collecting the reward.These accounts along with the numerous runaway slave ads mentioning the C,O Canal provides evidence that the canal was used not only as transportation route for fugitives escaping slavery but also as a destination point.The C,O Canal National Historical Park runs 184.5 miles from Georgetown in Washington DC to Cumberland in Western Maryland.Construction of the canal began in 1828 and progressed westward until reaching Cumberland in 1850.As the canal reached Western Maryland it becomes exceedingly close to Pennsylvania, a beacon for freedom seekers as a free state where help could easily be obtained.During the time of its construction, the canal provided a means for runaway slaves to finance their escape by posing as free and gaining employment within the labor intensive construction of the canal.This documentation is reflected in the historical record through the numerous runaway slave ads.\n\n"

    "ABSTRACT":"Established in 1832 and located in Farmington, Oakland County, Michigan is a small unassuming local historical site called the Quaker Cemetery and/or Quaker Burial Grounds, which is the final resting place of abolitionist and Underground Railroad conductor/agent Nathan Power (19 April 1801 - 20 January 1874). Under the guidance and spiritual instruction of his father Arthur Power, founder of Farmington, Nathan grew steadfast in the Quaker faith, and fighting against all odds dedicated himself to abolishing slavery in America. Farmington Michigan's first and oldest permanent Quaker settlement was a safe haven for freedom-seekers. Located approximately 17 miles northwest of Detroit, MI, Farmington was used as an alternative route on the UGRR when it was deemed too difficult for fugitives to cross the Detroit River to Canada when there was an abundant amount of slave-catchers hanging out on the shoreline. Farmington was a pivot point used by fugitives to move to other safe-havens through Oakland and Macomb counties. They would eventually exit Michigan further north at Port Huron, St. Clair County, MI. Nathan led the charge and answered the call for moving freedom-seekers in Oakland County. He dedicated his life to the cause of freedom, justice and equality for African Americans."

    "ABSTRACT":"Resting within the boundaries of the African-American Ancestral Burial Ground at Vale Cemetery is local legend Moses Viney. In 1840, Viney fled enslavement in Talbot County, Maryland, to seek freedom in the North. His journey with two other runaways brought him across the Choptank River to Delaware, from Philadelphia to New York City, up the Hudson River to Troy, and finally, on to his adopted home of Schenectady, New York. Most notably, Viney was given aid and direction by Underground Railroad affiliates at the Mother Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Philadelphia. After reaching relative safety within Schenectady's borders, Viney came under the employment of Union College President Eliphalet Nott. Through Nott's support, Viney sought asylum in Canada, while local officials successfully negotiated his emancipation. As a result of these combined efforts, Moses Viney was granted his right to freedom, and lived to become a beloved figure by college affiliates and the resident community.\n"

    "ABSTRACT":"The North Star Underground Railroad Museum celebrates the history of the Champlain Line of the Underground as it relates to seven northeastern New York Counties, Vermont and the Canadian Provinces of Quebec and Ontario. The theme of our museum's exhibits is Lake Champlain: Gateway to Freedom. We provide tours, offer lectures, present dramatic readings and hold workshops for children and adults. We develop outdoor interpretive panels. We bring to light little known stories of Africans and African Americans who were enslaved and freed in our region or followed the Champlain Line of the Underground Railroad to New York, Vermont or Canada. We honor the men and women who aided them. Many of our stories can be found on our website www.norhcountryundergroundrailroad.com Prior to the opening of our museum in May of 2011, Underground Railroad route maps did not include the Champlain Line. Our exhibits and programs have literally put the Champlain Line on the map."

    "ABSTRACT":"Melrose, a 500-acre property, was built on land in Loudoun County, VA, originally settled in the mid 1700s. It is related to the Underground Railroad because it was the home of both William Giddings and his slave Noble Robinson who escaped in 1862 to Union lines.\n\nOn the eve of the Civil War, Lt. Colonel William Giddings commanded a local regiment-the 56th-of Virginia's state militia. In late 1861 he was put in charge of constructing Confederate fortifications near the county seat of Leesburg, Virginia. General D.H. Hill, the senior officer in the county, ordered all able-bodied males - black and white -- not serving in the regular military be put to digging earthworks. To avoid the work, many fled north, including Noble Robinson, 24, a slave of Giddings. Robinson fled Melrose on January 12, 1862, to Union forces some eight miles away at Point of Rocks, Maryland, on the Potomac River. Two weeks later, with the permission of Federal officers, Robinson slipped back into Virginia and rescued his wife Martha and three young children, enslaved at a nearby plantation."

Among those who escaped from his properties in Prince George County were Jenny Oldham, George Oldham, Madison Ruffin, Edward Oldham, Sally Lewis, Harriet Ruffin, Steward Slaughter, Solomon Morris, Charles Davis, Henry Corsen, Jim Booker, Archer Lewis, James Spratley, Toby Bird, Patience Bird, Frank Lewis, Dilsy Slaughter, Jane Booker, Nancy Thompson, Paulina Ruffin, Richard Slaughter, Louisa Slaughter, Charlotte Cary, Agnes Ruffin, John Ruffin, Samuel Ruffin, Fanny Corn, Indianna Ruffin, Ida Booker, and Lavania Bird.\n\nDr. Richard Eppes was in America's top 1% of the plantation elite, by owning 130 enslaved people, and one of the wealthiest men in the country.\n\nFrom 1635 when Frances Eppes claimed this property based on the headrights of indentured people he brought from England - five of this group were black servants, to the end of the Civil War, there are stories of escape, resistance, freedom, and citizenship that connected the beginning of slavery in this country to its physical and Constitutional demise."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Battle of Pine Bluff phone audio tour highlights the role of former enslaved African Americans with Union defenses during the battle on October 25, 1863. Union soldiers began occupying Pine Bluff in September 1863, by the time of the battle a large number of African-American men, women, and children were associated with the contraband or freedmen's camp(s) in Pine Bluff. One personal account related to this situation was that of Boston Blackwell. Blackwell's slave narrative reveals that he and another young man \"ran for two days\" to make it to the \"Yankee camp in Pine Bluff.\" Blackwell also proudly recounted his role in the Battle of Pine Bluff as one of 300 men who served in the skirmish. The battle was proclaimed a Union victory, and Pine Bluff continued as Union-occupied territory serving as a place of freedom for an estimated 2,000 (Twentieth Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry) freedmen by January 1864.\n\nThe approximately twelve-minute tour is available by mobile phone (501.203.3015; Stop # 16) and internet (http://www.arkansascivilwar150.com/). On-site signage for the program is located in Pine Bluff, Arkansas near the site of the actual battle in downtown Pine Bluff, at the intersection of Barraque Pine Streets.\n\nThe phone audio tour is part of an overall, statewide interpretive program that highlights other Civil War battles fought in Arkansas.\n"

    "ABSTRACT":"Built for the Wesleyan Methodist's Illinois Institute in 1853, Blanchard Hall in Wheaton, Illinois served as the main college building for all activities and instruction, and served as a stop on the Underground Railroad. Founded by Underground Railroad activist, the Institute was first led by well-known abolitionist and Underground Railroad conductor, Rev. John Cross. After years of financial struggle the Wesleyans brought fellow abolitionist Rev. Jonathan Blanchard to take leadership of the struggling institution. Blanchard was one of Theodore Dwight Weld's Seventy and a conductor on the Underground Railroad in Cincinnati and Western Illinois. According to a memoir by Ezra Cook in Charles Clark's \"History of the Thirty-Ninth Regiment Illinois Volunteer Veteran Infantry\" (published under the auspices of the Veteran Association of the Regiment in 1889), \"runaway slaves were perfectly safe in the College building, even when no attempt was made to conceal their presence.With hundreds of others, I have seen and talked with such fugitives in the college chapel. Of course they soon took a night train well-guarded to the next station on the U. G. R. R.\" (p. 490). Cook provides the first \"hard\" evidence to support the claims of Underground Railroad activity occurring on campus. In 1859, Blanchard renamed the school Wheaton College, which is still in existence, to honor benefactor and Illinois Institute trustee Warren L. Wheaton.\n\nBlanchard Hall is a symbol of Wheaton's unique pioneering role in abolitionism, its matriculation of women on an equal basis, and its matriculation of students of color, including the graduation of the Illinois' first African-American college graduate.\n\nIn 1979 Blanchard Hall was added to the National Register of Historic Places."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Gillett property (a.k.a. the Fitzsimmons House), located at 1005 Grove Street in Jacksonville, Illinois, was used in at least one incident as a hiding place for three enslaved women escaping from St. Louis, Missouri on the Underground Railroad in 1849. Evidence of the incident is found in several printed versions of the episode and in a paper written in 1905 by Julia Wolcott Carter, the daughter of Elihu Wolcott, the acknowledged leader of the Underground Railroad movement in Jacksonville. Carter's evidence is based on her interview with Underground Railroad activist Jonathan Baldwin Turner. According to Turner, the three women had been hidden \"in an old shanty on what is now known as the Fitzsimmons place (the Gillett property)\" before being transported to another location.\n\nBecause the \"shanty\" no longer exists, the house which was associated with the property at the time the incident occurred, it is the best place to represent this history. The house is now part of Illinois College."

    "ABSTRACT":"Family and local residents' accounts, documented oral histories and primary documentation attest that New Philadelphia and area residents participated actively in the Underground Railroad by concealing, harboring and sometimes accompanying runaway African Americans to Canada. New Philadelphia, Illinois was a gathering place for African Americans of the region and, although integrated, regarded by many local residents as a black town.\n\nFounded in 1836, New Philadelphia is the first town in our nation legally registered by an African American. The town traces its association to resist enslavement to founder Frank McWorter. Before moving to Illinois from Kentucky in 1830, McWorter purchased freedom for his wife, himself and a son who had fled to Canada. Risking capture by slave trackers, the McWorters returned to Kentucky to purchase freedom for family members. McWorter freed sixteen family members with funds earned through entrepreneurial enterprises.\n\nNow an archaeological site with only a few building foundations visible on the landscape, New Philadelphia was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2005 for its potential to provide nationally significant information about the lifeways and relationships of African Americans and European Americans in a pioneer setting, and designated a National Historic Landmark in 2009 for its potential to yield information of major scientific importance and to affect archaeological theories, concepts and ideas.\n\nThe site is owned by The Archaeological Conservancy, The New Philadelphia Association, and The Philadelphia Land Trust.\n\n"

    "ABSTRACT":"This application is nominating Quinn Chapel African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church in Brooklyn, Illinois (originally called the Brooklyn AME Church). One of the earliest AME churches in the state, the church was part of the Brooklyn community, an antebellum town home to many free blacks and former slaves and a well acknowledged stop on the Underground Railroad.Founded by black abolitionists William Paul Quinn and Priscilla Baltimore in 1839, members of the congregation, including Baltimore and the Carper family, were active agents in the Underground Railroad. It is also associated with Jordan Winston Early, another AME preacher and abolitionist who is said to have built the first church building. The oral tradition passed down in the town names the pre-Civil War church building as a station on the Underground Railroad. Although no longer in its original location, Quinn Chapel is still an active church and remains a vital social institution 174 years after its founding. Furthermore, the current church stands on property once owned by Priscilla Baltimore, and it is believed that she utilized the surviving basement as a place to hide freedom seekers.\n\n"

    "ABSTRACT":"Fort Scott served as a safe haven for refugees, including many escaped and liberated slaves, during the Civil War. While women and children found refuge here, many able bodied formerly enslaved men filled the ranks of the 1st and 2nd Kansas Colored Volunteer Infantry Regiments, elements of which were recruited and organized at Fort Scott. While many African-Americans moved on after the war, some stayed and became a part of the community.\n\nFort Scott National Historic Site is part of the National Park System and recognized as a National Historic Landmark. It was a US Army frontier fort from 1842-1853, guarding the Permanent Indian Frontier. The fort buildings were auctioned in 1855 and became the nucleus of the civilian Town of Fort Scott, which was a center of Bleeding Kansas intrigue during territorial days (1855-1861). Predominantly pro-slave at its founding, the town and county developed a free-state focus by 1859. The town was fortified during the Civil War and became the primary US Army supply depot, training center, and general hospital in southeast Kansas.\n\n"

    "ABSTRACT":"The Riley House/Bolten House is a historic resource of local, state, national, and international significance because of its association with Josiah Henson, whose memoirs were used in development of Harriet Beecher Stowe's landmark novel, \"Uncle Tom's Cabin.\" The Riley plantation was where Henson lived and worked as a slave from 1795 to 1830. The existing building is the ca. 1800 Chesapeake Tidewater-style frame domestic dwelling with a ca. 1850 log kitchen wing. Many of his experiences of living as a slave on the Riley property are vividly depicted in his memoirs and are recreated in Stowe's fictional account. Henson eventually escaped to Canada, where he established a \"fugitive slave\" colony and became a speaker and writer. Josiah Henson's narrative of his road from slavery to freedom received worldwide praise and readership. During the height of its publication, Henson's story was the third most popular slave narrative in the world, following the seminal works produced by Frederick Douglass and Olaudah Equiano. By 1877, \"The Life of Josiah Henson\" had sold over a quarter of a million copies. Ultimately, Henson's experience, as interpreted through Stowe's book, helped facilitate a growing abolition movement in the United States."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Underground Railroad Experience Trail, 2 miles long, is used both as a docent-guided and a self-guided hike through woods and fields that recreates, at least in part, the experience of escaping on the Underground Railroad. The trail in Montgomery County, Maryland, begins at Woodlawn, a 19th century plantation occupied by Dr. William Palmer, a former Quaker who owned several slaves. The site is publicly owned. There is a unique ca. 1832 stone barn near the house that will eventually be converted to a visitor center for the Montgomery County Underground Railroad/Quaker Heritage Cluster. The trail ends at a spring that was used by farms on the outskirts of a Quaker town settled in the 1720s and named for the spring, Sandy Spring. As much as possible, the trail resembles a trail in the early 1800s with native plants, natural surfaces, a replica wooden bridge over a creek, and no sign of modern life. The terrain includes woodlands, a steep descent to a creek, and a cultivated field. The trail is interpreted with a kiosk at the trailhead, modest interpretive signage, and a handout for self-guided tours. The trail is not handicapped-accessible, but is intended for use by all ages."

    "ABSTRACT":"Heuston Burying Ground in Brunswick, Maine, began in 1829 as a traditional rural family burying ground when mid-coast Maine African American community leaders, Francis and Mahitable Heuston, set aside a piece of their farm as the final resting place of their daughter, Pamelia. For the next one hundred thirty-five years Heuston friends and family in the African American community were buried there. Some, like Francis and Mahitable, were conductors in the Underground Railroad.\n\nOne UGRR passenger was Clara Battease, who in 1850 escaped slavery with the aid of the mid-coast African American community and was hidden in the Heuston home. She gave birth to daughter Emma one month later. Both because of the rural nature of the community and the need to protect one another's origins, documentation for those interred in the cemetery is incomplete. Family records, however, support that Emma was laid to rest in Heuston Burying Ground when she died in 1871 at age 21. The last documented burial was of Francis amd Mahitable's great-grandson, Austin Hopkins, who died in 1954.\n\nThere are no black churches, schools or fraternal organizations in Bath or Brunswick, making Heuston Burying Ground the only visible monument to the area's former African American community."

    "ABSTRACT":"Battle of Island Mound State Historic Site preserves and interprets the Toothman Farmstead (christened \"Fort Africa\" by the black soldiers who occupied the site) and interprets the nationally significant battle that took place at Island Mound. The African American soldiers who fought at Island Mound were members of the First Kansas Colored Volunteer Infantry. The site's connection to the Underground Railroad stems from the fact that many of the soldiers who comprised the First Kansas Colored were former Missouri Slaves who had escaped into Kansas and freedom. In October of 1862, several months before the Emancipation Proclamation, these African American soldiers marched into Bates County with orders to clear out the band of southern sympathizing guerrillas who had gathered there. Fort Africa, where they camped, is significant as the base of operations for the First Kansas Colored. The Battle of Island Mound took place about a mile south of Fort Africa. It was at the Battle of Island Mound that black soldiers engaged in combat for the first time in the Civil War. The bravery shown by these black men and their white officers received national publicity and helped to pave the way for the acceptance of African Americans into the U.S. army.\n\nThe site is open from sunrise to sunset - year-round.\n\nManaged by Stockton State Park, 19100 S.

    "ABSTRACT":"In August of 1861, Union forces defeated Confederate batteries at Hatteras Inlet and at Forts Clark and Hatteras. Word of this victory spread quickly and prompted large numbers of enslaved people to escape from the mainland and Roanoke Island to freedom on Hatteras Island. Responsibility for sheltering and feeding these former enslaved people fell on the Union forces. Hotel De'Afrique was part of that provision. Hundreds of runaways arrived and in exchange for unloading supply vessels received food and housing. Many of these freedom seekers were able to provide strategic information regarding Confederate positions. This information led to Union victories. Hotel De'Afrique was the first contraband camp to be established by the military in North Carolina, therefore providing the first safe haven for freedom seekers in the state.\n\nThere were two sites for Hotel De'Afrique on Forts Clark and Hatteras. They have both since disappeared due to erosion and flooding. A monument was established to tell the story in April 2012.\n\nThe Hotel De'Afrique Monument is located at Cape Hatteras National Seashore, a national park service site in Hatteras, North Carolina.\n\n\n\n"

Ruth always dreamed of escaping slavery, and one day she did, successfully making her escape from Maryland to New York. While in the North, she met Frederick Douglass, a fellow freedom seeker who by then was a famous abolitionist who took a liking to Ruth. He claimed her to be his long lost sister, looking at how they were born around the same area and that they both vaguely remembered each other. For a long time, Ruth lived with Frederick Douglass and took care of his children and wife while he was away in other countries. Ruth later married and had kids. She kept in touch with Frederick Douglass through letters for the rest of her life. In later life, Ruth moved with her daughter and son-in-law to Nebraska where she lived the remainder of her life."

The Oberlin College Archives holds primary resources, such as correspondence and photographs, documenting Oberlin's significant role in the fight against the institution of slavery.\n\nBy way of example, antislavery supporters influenced the decision by the Oberlin Collegiate Institute (name changed to Oberlin College in 1850) Board of Trustees to admit African American students in 1835.The minutes of the Board provide documentation for this critical period in Oberlin's History.Other materials document the famous Oberlin-Wellington Rescue Case, a pivotal event in Oberlin's involvement in the Underground Railroad.\n\nThe Oberlin College Library and Special Collections also contain monographs, printed matter, manuscripts, and artifacts relating to Oberlin's and the nation's antislavery activity, includingmaterials related to university graduates and former students who either supported the work of or participated in the Underground Railroad across the country, as freedom seekers and/or those who provided assistance.\n"

    "ABSTRACT":"Pleasant Hill Cemetery (AKA Rushville Cemetery),aruralcemeterylocated in Fairfield County, Ohio, contains burials significant to the history of the UGRR. The cemetery is the burial place of Joe Selby, a freedom seeker who died in nearby Rushville, Ohio.Selby's flight to freedom ended in the village of Rushville when he died while in the care of Dr. Simon Hyde, a local physician and abolitionist, who is also buried in the cemetery.Hyde was an early pioneer of Fairfield County, Ohio and provided medical care to an untold number of freedom seekers that passed through the area. In 1856, Selby's story was immortalized in the song \"Darling Nelly Gray\". The song was written by Benjamin Hanby, son of Hyde's co-conspirator in Underground Railroad activities, Reverend William Hanby of the United Brethern Church.\n\n\nOther burials in the cemetery include four to six other fugitive slaves buried in unmarked graves and members of the Hanby family.\n\nThe still active cemeteryis open to the public from dawn to dusk daily.Itislocated on Basore Road (south of the village of Rushville, OH.Off US Route 22, just east of Ohio Route 664).Range 17, Township 17, Section 17.

    "ABSTRACT":"Established in 1981, The Smith Library of Regional History is a division of the Lane Public Libraries and is the premiere regional history library in Butler County, Ohio. Its holdings include books, newspapers, maps, photographs, manuscripts, archives, and oral histories as well as copies or transcripts of county records for Butler County and some surrounding counties. The collection time period covers the late 1700s to the present with emphasis on the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nDespite the general scarcity of evidence for Underground Railroad study, the Smith Library has information on routes through Butler County that led to stops in Preble County to the immediate north and to nearby counties in Indiana. Underground Railroad oral histories within Oxford's African American community led to the discovery of substantiating information in deeds, maps, and other documents in the Smith Library.\n\nSome representative examples of the Smith Library's contribution to Underground Railroad study include providing information for students' school projects, local newspaper articles, a state NAACP conference, a regional history presentation, a national journal article, and more.\n\n"

    "ABSTRACT":"Indian Territory was the edge of the American frontier in the Trans-Mississippi campaign of the Civil War, and represented a buffer between the free state of Kansas and the slave holding state of Texas. The battle of Honey Springs (July 17, 1863) was the pivot point of the Civil War in Indian Territory and is the largest military clash ever to have occurred in Oklahoma.\n\nAt Honey Springs Americans of all colors fought and died with determination to win liberty for themselves and their cause. With courage men willingly proved themselves and fought for justice, honor and freedom.\n\nFreedom was as diverse as the cultures represented. To some freedom meant returning to life as it was before the Civil War, to some it included living peaceably in a new land and for others freedom from the bonds of slavery.\n\nFor freedmen and runaway slaves Honey Springs was an opportunity to overthrow oppression and many found themselves on the frontlines of freedom. With the aide of these individuals the government was able to form regiments that proved themselves with distinction and showed all that hostilities such as Honey Springs could be won with their support and would turn the tide of the war."

    "ABSTRACT":"Sandyvale Cemetery, a commemorative site for Underground Railroad activity, is located in the Hornerstown section of the city of Johnstown and became a cemetery in 1856. According to newspaper obituaries, the only remaining source of information, buried in Sandyvale are several conductors of Johnstown's Underground Railroad network; specifically, James Heslop, Charlotte Heslop, John Cushon, Benjamin SLick, and William Slick. It was James Heslop, John Cushon, and William Slick who were involved in the 1837 incident involving two runaway slaves, Patrick and Abraham, who were brought to Johnstown after a harrowing escape from John Sherrard's farm in Bath, Virginia (present-day West Virginia) The abolitionists who worked to save Patrick and Abraham were also responsible for others who managed to obtain freedom with their help. Their story can only be remembered and told at Sandyvale; a cemetery that itself has almost been lost to time due to the ravishing of three major floods in 1889, 1936 and finally 1977. Both Sandyvale and the story of the UGRR are critical to the history of this region."

    "ABSTRACT":"Fort Howell was constructed in 1864 on Hilton Head Island to defend the nearby freedmen's village of Mitchelville from possible Confederate raids. Mitchelville was established in 1862 to provide a community where freedom seekers could live and self-govern under their new-found freedom under the protection of the Union Army. Mitchelville was the clearest example of the Port Royal Experiment, whereby formerly enslaved people developed fighting skills as well as skills needed to prosper as American citizens. By 1864, Union units were being drawn to aid operations further north. As the number of troops dwindled, military operations in the area transitioned from offensive to defensive. Three major new earthworks were constructed on Hilton Head, including Fort Howell, which was located to provide protection for Mitchelville. Fort Howell was constructed in part by the 32nd Infantry Regiment, United States Colored Troops Infantry (USCT). This unit, mustered in Pennsylvania from free Black volunteers coming from Maryland, Delaware, and Pennsylvania.\n\n"

    "ABSTRACT":"The Mitchelville Freedom Park commemorates the historic town of Mitchelville, South Carolina. Two distinct phases qualified Mitchelville as an important Underground Railroad site. It was the site of mass escapes from Hilton Head Island plantations when Union troops entered Port Royal Sound in November 1861. As the battle began, many of those enslaved on the island escaped into the nearby forests, where they hid until Union troops fully occupied the area. After its establishment, Mitchelville then became the destination for waves of freedom seekers fleeing bondage in the nearby Confederate states of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. Mitchelville was the heart of the \"Port Royal Experiments,\" termed a \"rehearsal for Reconstruction.\" The federal experiments proved to a skeptical American public that African Americans would fight for freedom and country, work for wages within a free enterprise labor system, and live responsibly as independent citizens. Mitchelville was constructed, inhabited, and governed exclusively by previously enslaved freedom seekers. Activities in this settlement were heavily covered by northern newspapers. The successes at Mitchelville ultimately influenced national Reconstruction policies."

    "ABSTRACT":"Seaford's Gateway Park in this case was Harriet Tubman's €œGateway to Freedom€ in October of 1856. In Baltimore, Harriet was able to find the slave, Tilly, the fiancÃ©e of an already escaped slave in Canada, and brought her across the Chesapeake, to Seaford, Delaware by steamboat. The steamboat probably landed at the present site of the City of Seaford's Riverwalk, like most steamers with passengers. This area was the center of town in the time. Harriet and Tilly spent the night at the hotel at the top of the hill, where Gateway Park is today. They were nearly arrested by slave traders the next morning, but safely continued on their\nway by train to Camden, Delaware and then by carriage to Thomas Garrett in Wilmington. Tubman expert, Dr. Kate Larson, referred to the Tilly story in her book, Harriet Tubman, Portrait of an American Hero, as €œone of her most complicated and clever escape attempts€. The Tilly Story is especially unique in that Thomas Garret immediately documented the story in detail, as he wrote the letter of Oct 24,1856 to Eliza Wigham in Scotland, immediately after hearing it, while the story was fresh in his mind and in Harriet Tubman's.

    "ABSTRACT":"Overlooking the city is the \"Shattering Silence\" monument, located in Des Moines, Iowa, on the State Capitol grounds, located adjacent to the state's current Supreme Court building. The monument is a standing memorial of the Iowa Territorial Supreme Court's first case, \"In the Matter of Ralph, (a colored man,) on Habeas Corpus\" (1839). Installed in 2009, the public art sculpture designed by artist James Ellwanger commemorates the 170th anniversary of this landmark fugitive slave court case. This case began in 1834 when an enslaved man by the name of Ralph Montgomery contracted with his owner Jordan Montgomery to travel to Iowa. Ralph went to Dubuque with the intent of mining the local mineral fields in order to gain the 550 dollars required to purchase his freedom. After failing to uphold his end of the written contract, Ralph was then captured as a fugitive slave to be sent back to his owner in Missouri. The intervention of two Irish farmers, Patrick Quigley and Alexander Butterworth, allowed Ralph to be returned to Dubuque for a fair trial. The case was quickly sent on to the Territorial Supreme Court where Ralph was fittingly declared free on the Fourth of July in the summer of 1839 because the court held, \"no man in this territory can be reduced to slavery.\"\n\n"

    "ABSTRACT":"In April 1856, Harriet Tubman arrived on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, hoping to rescue her sister Rachel and Rachel's children. Unable to do so, Tubman was informed by the mother of another freedom seeker she had helped escape sometime before that four enslaved men laboring in Dorchester County, MD, were ready to leave with her instead. It was a long and difficult trip, with slave catchers hot on their trail. UGRR agent Sydney Gay of New York City, wrote that \"Captain Tubman\" had arrived safely with her charges on May 14th. The four men had come from \"the same neighborhood,\" that is, \"Cabin Creek\" outside of East New Market along the Choptank River. Benjamin Jackson and James Coleman had both been enslaved by Isaac Henry Wright, whose plantations included some of the largest peach farms on the Eastern Shore. The third freedom seeker, Henry Hopkins, was enslaved by John Houston, also from East New Market/Secretary, and the fourth, William A. Connoway [aka Cook], was enslaved by Levin Hodson. Tubman had led them safely to New Castle, Delaware, but the relentless slave catchers eager for the high rewards for their capture slowed them down, forcing them to stay hidden for several days. Thomas Garrett in Wilmington, DE, was able to finally forward them to William Still, UGRR agent in Philadelphia. Still noted their arrival and forwarded them onto Gay who sent them onto Syracuse. They arrived in Canada, settling among other freedom seekers they knew. The nominated site, the Kral Farm, remains intact and includes nearly about one-half of the original and larger farm estate of Isaac Henry Wright, from whom Jackson and Coleman fled.\n"

    "ABSTRACT":"During the Civil War, the Robert A(llison) Brown House near Harrisonville, Missouri was the site of a raid by Union Soldiers in January, 1862.Members of the 7thKansas Calvary took several of those enslaved by Brown as contraband. Brown, who owned some fifty slaves, was one of the largest slave owners in Cass County; however, in 1861 he had removed many of them to Texas. As a result when the raid took place there were only two enslaved women, one male and several children present. Those remaining were taken as contrabands into Kansas.\n\nThe house, grounds, and slave quarters that comprised the original property still remain. The red brick house in Classic Revival style was built in 1850 by Brown's slaves and survives with minimal alteration. The slave quarters are a one story, faithfully restored red brick building measuring 18 x 72 feet. Of special interest are graphic designs hidden underneath the mantle in the third room. The patterns were recognized by restoration experts from MO DNR as West-African designs.\n\nThe property, a private residence, is still owned by direct Brown descendants and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Tours of the home can be arranged by contacting the owner through the Cass County Historical Society. National Register of Historic Places, Robert A. Brown, Harrisonville, Cass County, Missouri, National Register #70000327."

McWilliams was born enslaved in Madison County, Kentucky, in 1843. He and his parents were sold to a slave owner in Missouri when McWilliams was an infant. At the age of 10, McWilliams was sold for the last time to a man in Buchanan County, Missouri. In 1863, McWilliams made the brave decision to escape from slavery and fled to Kansas. On his way to Kansas, McWilliams went to St. Joseph, Missouri, and received aid from Union recruiters. On July 12th, 1863, McWilliams enlisted in the 2nd Kansas Colored Infantry in Elwood, Kansas. He served with Union army until the end of the Civil War in 1865. After the war, McWilliams married Sarah Jay Stanton, who also had escaped slavery, on December 25th, 1868. The McWilliams family finally settled in Lincoln, Nebraska in 1886. McWilliams and his wife became ordained ministers and founded Lincoln's first integrated church, the Third Christian Church, now known as the Christ Temple Mission Church. McWilliams died on March 20th, 1917 in Lincoln, Nebraska, and was buried in the Civil War Veteran's Circle of the Wyuka Cemetery.\n\nJohn J McWilliams' burial site is featured on the cemetery's published tour, \"Wyuka Cemetery: A Driving , Walking Tour,\" which is available online at <a href='http://wyukafoundation.org/pdf/WyukaTourBook.pdf' rel='nofollow ugc'>http://wyukafoundation.org/pdf/WyukaTourBook.pdf</a>."

    "ABSTRACT":"The site of the Nebraska House, a former hotel completed in 1857 and located in Brownville, Nebraska, was associated with an escape in which a bloody shootout between slave catchers and freedom seekers occurred. In the fall of 1857, three freedom seekers escaped from Platte County, Missouri. While traveling from Kansas and into the Territory of Nebraska, the freedom seekers were spotted a few miles south of the town of Brownville.Hoping to make some money catching runaway slaves, four men, J.R. Davis, Thomas Williams, Archie Handley and William Myers pursued the three freedom seekers. When the two parties encountered one another a violent shootout broke out.In result, an unnamed freedom seeker was shot in the arm and Myers mortally wounded. The other two freedom seekers escaped, while the injured one was held at the Nebraska House, and put into the hands of deputy sheriff, Ben Thompson. While in the custody of Thompson, the freedom seeker was protected from a mob of pro slavery sympathizers that wanted to kill him for the murder of a white man. The freedom seeker was charged with murder, however, the charges were eventually dropped because it was determined that it was not he, but one of the other two freedom seekers who had shot Myers. After his release from the Nemaha County Jail, the wounded freedom seeker was returned to slavery in Missouri."

Described as a northern terminus of the Underground Railroad, his house served as one of the last stops that individuals escaping slavery reached had before being ferried over to Canada. The house was also known as \"Old Mother Hubbard's Cupboard\" and \"The Great Emporium.\" Today the house, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is home to the Hubbard House Underground Railroad Museum with displays devoted to recreating how the house looked in William Hubbard's time, as well as displays for the Civil War and local history.\n\nThe Hubbard House Underground Railroad Museum is open during the summer to visitors, with the season lasting from Memorial Day through Labor Day.

    "ABSTRACT":"William and Ellen Craft became international heroes as people seeking freedom from enslavement in Macon, Georgia. They took advantage of Ellen's light skinned complexion to pose as a wealthy landowner with William serving as personal servant. Their escape began from the residence at 830 Mulberry Street where the couple lived and Ellen had become a trusted servant. Ellen was a wedding gift to her half-sister Eliza when she married Dr. Robert Collins. Longing for freedom, the Crafts obtained holiday passes from their masters and boarded a train in Macon bound for Savannah shortly before Christmas on December 21, 1848. Avoiding confrontation and inquiries from transportation agents, the Crafts successfully arrived in Philadelphia on Christmas day where they were met by abolitionists who provided food and shelter. With the help of others, they successfully eluded slave hunters before moving to the safer areas near Boston and England before eventually returning to Georgia in April 1870 to help former enslaved people."

Owner Marla Jackson has taught some 500 students how to research, design and showcase African-American stories through quilts and multi-media. Her \"Beyond the Book\" curriculum includes textile dyeing, sewing, design and quilting to visualize African-American stories. Examples of their Underground Railroad themed quilts include John Brown, the First Kansas Colored Volunteer Infantry, Quantrill's Raid on Lawrence, and Harriet Tubman. A 2014 project with Freedom's Frontier National Heritage Area will explore the life of an enslaved seamstress, Maria Rodgers Martin, who was enslaved at the Robert A. Brown House, a Network to Freedom site in Missouri and found freedom in Kansas.\n<p align='justify'>Jackson is a nationally known visual artist recognized for her Story Quilts. She recently completed a term as artist-in-residence for Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site in Topeka where she helped students explore their African-American heritage. \"I am particularly drawn to stories and images depicting slavery and freedom, specifically as it resulted from efforts of the Underground Railroad,\" Jackson stated in an April 7, 2013 article in the \"Lawrence Journal World\".</p>"

    "ABSTRACT":"Jane Kane's escape from the Horatio Jones plantation on Buttons Creek near Church Creek, Maryland is nominated to the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom. On Christmas Eve, 1854, Jane Kane fled from her enslaver, Horatio Jones. Kane was the fiancÃ© of Harriet Tubman's brother, Ben Ross, Jr., and the two conspired to run away together when Tubman returned to Maryland to affect the escape of three of her brothers.Jones's plantation was situated along the Blackwater River and Buttons Creek, next to the former Anthony Thompson plantation where the Ross family had once been enslaved in Dorchester County, MD. Jane used a disguise €œ men's clothing €œ to successfully flee Jones, and her escape is one of the few first person narratives dictated to and published by abolitionist Benjamin Drew in Canada in 1855. A significant portion of the original Jones plantation is now owned by Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge in Dorchester County.This escape is featured in the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Byway map guide and audio tour.Visitors can kayak or canoe to Buttons Creek via the Blackwater River and view from the water the landscapes where Jane would have been held in slavery and from where she fled."

In late July 1858, seven enslaved people fled from near Cambridge, MD in Dorchester County with the help of Hugh Hazlett, an Irish immigrant who worked as a wood sawyer.Winding their way through Caroline County, the group was captured between Henderson and Templeville in the northeast corner of the county along the border with Queen Anne's County, MD and Kent County, DE.The group had been betrayed by a free African America named Jesse Perry, who in collusion with a group of white men set an ambush for them.After their capture, Hazlett and the others were brought to Denton and placed in the county jail next to the courthouse to be later taken for trial in Dorchester County. Several of the freedom seekers were related to members of a large party of twenty-eight self liberators, who fled Cambridge in October, 1857.Hazlett and the freedom seekers were returned by steamboat down the Choptank River to Cambridge, where Hazlett was threatened with an angry mob. The freedom seekers were re-enslaved, and Hazlett was tried and convicted and sent to prison for forty-four years.In 1849, Isaac Gibson, a free African American, helped an enslaved man named John Stokes in an unsuccessful attempt to flee his enslaver in Hillsborough, Caroline County.Captured and jailed in Denton, Gibson was tried and convicted at the Caroline County Courthouse in March 1851.He was sentenced to a little more than three years in prison."

    "ABSTRACT":" The nominated site is the former location of the town of Denton Steamboat Wharf along Choptank River where captured Underground Railroad agent Hugh Hazlett and seven freedom seekers boarded the Steamer Kent for return to Cambridge, Maryland, from which they had fled. Late at night on Saturday, July 24, 1858, William Henry Cornish, Mary Light, Charles Anthony Light, Esther Cornish, Solomon Cornish, Thomas Ridout, and John Green, fled their enslavers in the Town Point and Cambridge area in Dorchester County, Maryland. Their risky escape relied on the help they received from a white conductor, an Irish immigrant named Hugh Hazlett. Winding their way through neighboring Caroline County, the group was captured between Henderson and Templeville in the northeast corner of the Caroline County along the border with Queen Anne's County, MD and Kent County, DE. The group had been betrayed by a free African America named Jesse Perry, who in collusion with a group of white men set an ambush for them.  After their capture, Hazlett and the others were brought to Denton and placed in the County jail next to the County Courthouse. Several of the freedom seekers were related to members of a large party of twenty-eight who fled Cambridge in October, 1857. Hazlett and the freedom seekers were returned by steamboat, which was docked at the wharf across the river from the courthouse, down the Choptank River to Cambridge for trial. The freedom seekers were re-enslaved, and Hazlett was convicted and sent to prison for forty-four years."

    "ABSTRACT":"The night of Saturday, July 24, 1858, William Henry Cornish, Mary Light, Charles Anthony Light, Esther Cornish, Solomon Cornish, Thomas Rideout, and John Green, fled their enslavers in the Town Point and Cambridge areas in Dorchester County, Maryland. Their escape relied on the help from a white conductor, an Irish immigrant and wood sawyer named Hugh Hazlett. Several of the freedom seekers were related to members of a large party of 28 who fled Cambridge in October, 1857. Winding their way northeast, the group was captured in northeastern Caroline County, 50 miles away. They were betrayed by a free African American named Jesse Perry, who colluded with a group of white men and set an ambush for them. Hazlett and the others were jailed in Denton, Caroline County, to await rendition back to Cambridge, Dorchester County. On the morning of August 2, Hazlett and the freedom seekers traveled on the steamboat Kent from Denton via the Choptank River to Cambridge, where a mob had gathered to await their arrival at Long Wharf. The sheriff feared the mob would lynch Hazlett, so he ordered the steamboat to leave Long Wharf and dock at another location upriver. Hazlett was later safely secured in the Cambridge jail. The freedom seekers were re-enslaved, and Hazlett was tried and convicted and sent to prison for 44 years. OOn Christmas Day 1861, John Wesley and George Hackett fled from Bucktown, Dorchester County. Using a forged pass, Hughes boarded the steamer Kent at Long Wharf. On his way to Baltimore, the suspicious captain arrested Hughes and returned him to Cambridge via the steamboat Champion, where Hughes was returned to his enslaver, Pritchettt Meredith. The Long Wharf itself is no longer extant, but the site now is a publicly owned waterfront location for pedestrians, boats, bikes and motor vehicles."

    "ABSTRACT":"The northwest side of Marsh Creek Bridge is the nominated portion of the former Anthony C. Thompson \"Poplar Neck\" plantation where Harriet Tubman conducted several escape missions during the 1850's.The northwest side of the Marsh Creek Bridge is nominated because it is the portion of the plantation owned by Caroline County and accessible to the public today. The rest of the former plantation is privately owned.Harriet Tubman's parents, Ben and Rit Ross were active in the Underground Railroad from their home on this large plantation in Caroline County, MD. They assisted Tubman, her brothers, and others as they escaped from or through here. Harriet Tubman led her three brothers, Robert, Henry, and Ben, Ben's fiancÃ© Jane Kane, and friends John Chase and Peter Jackson to freedom on Christmas Day 1854 from this place.With Ben Ross's aid, Tubman was able to affect the escape of Josiah Bailey, his brother William Bailey, and friends Peter Pennington and Eliza Manokey from here to Canada in November 1856.Josiah was a skilled timber foreman for shipbuilder William R. Hughlett at Jamaica Point in Talbot County, six miles downriver from here.In November 1856, Josiah rowed up the Choptank River at night, to Poplar Neck where he told Ben Ross they were ready to flee when Tubman was ready to go.They were hotly pursued by their enslavers, who offered a reward of $2600 for the capture of the fugitives, including $1500 for Josiah Bailey, one of the highest ever for a Maryland slave. Later, after Ben and Rit provided aid in the escape of eight enslaved people in March 1857 from Dorchester County, their Underground Railroad activities were exposed.Threatened with arrest, their daughter Harriet Tubman returned from Canada to rescue them, bringing them safely to St. Catharines, Ontario.William Cornish, enslaved by Thomas Dail and his sons of Dorchester County, fled slavery while attending a Methodist Camp meeting at Marsh Creek in August of 1856"

    "ABSTRACT":"The Richard Potter Home Site is relevant to the Underground Railroad because it was in the post Civil-War residence (ca. 1866-1878) of Richard Potter in Denton, Maryland that he wrote his kidnapping narrative.His ownership is documented by the 1870 census for Denton and Caroline County land records.\nIn Denton Maryland, in1853, African American and white residents celebrated the rescue and return of Richard John Potter, a free black youth who had been kidnapped from Greensboro, Caroline County, MD and sold into slavery to Delaware. Born free around 1838 in Greensboro, Richard was indentured in 1848 by his mother, Sydney Potter, to Batchelder C. Skinner, a farmer living near Greensboro.Finding that he no longer could use Richard's labour, Skinner leased him, illegally, to Edward Taylor, another farmer near Greensboro, sometime around 1852.Taylor was cruel and abusive.When Richard's parents sued in court to cancel their son's indenture, Taylor schemed to sell Potter as a slave.In a trap set by Taylor, Potter was kidnapped from Taylor's farm and sold to a man named Vaughn, who lived near Concord, in Sussex, DE. With search parties hot on Potter's trail, Vaughn decided to kill him.Fortunately, young Richard fled from the Vaughn home and found refuge with a sympathetic neighbour, Mrs. Short.Potter was rescued and brought back to Denton, Caroline Co., and while resting on the steps of the local hotel at this site on Courthouse Square, he was greeted by his joyful parents and cheering crowds. Potter's indenture, kidnapping, and rescue are vividly documented in his memoir, \"The Narrative of the Experience, Adventures, and Escape of Richard Potter,\" first published in 1866."

    "ABSTRACT":"On December 10, 1828, Bob Manoca (Manokey) fled from the Staplefort family, whose plantation sat on the west side of the Little Blackwater River near the Little Blackwater Bridge in Dorchester County, Maryland.The Little and Big Blackwater rivers provided water access to the area's farms from the late 17th century through the 19th century, facilitating the movement of goods to and from markets around the Chesapeake and beyond. The Stapleforts advertised a $150 reward for the capture and return of the thirty-six year old man, noting that Manoca was a very skilled man, \"a great sawyer, having followed it ever since he was about 18 years of age.\"The Stapleforts believed that Manoca was heading to Baltimore, then on to Philadelphia or New York.Given his experience as a sawyer and the Staplefort's home on a navigable river, Manoca would have been familiar with the watermen who manned the vessels that carried the coveted timber to shipyards throughout the Chesapeake and as far away as New England.Such relationships would have facilitated quick and reliable transportation for his escape. The farm, now wholly included within the boundaries of Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge and situated along Wildlife Drive, is also located across the river from the site where Harriet Tubman's mother and grandmother were once enslaved. Visitors may drive along the Little Blackwater Bridge or Wildlife Drive to see the Staplefort farm where Bob Manokey fled."

They provide their documentation regarding Underground Railroad flight stories/individuals who assisted and routes that may have been used €œ both water and land. Noted scholars are selected as keynote speakers to set the stage of a topic such as genealogy.Up to thirty workshop leaders engage participants in their research. People just starting their research are recognized, as are those who have made Underground Railroad history their life work.The conference provides updates on the state park development, the national monument status and potential national park status.The conference is managed by committed volunteers who have made this a community commitment."

    "ABSTRACT":"By the early 1850s, the site of Finney's Barn, operated by Seymour Finney, in connection with his Detroit hotel, was an important Underground Railroad station. The barn was ideally situated at the northern terminus of Underground Railroad networks in Michigan and from nearby states. Up in the hayloft or wedged into false-bottomed wagons, the formerly enslaved waited until the dark of night to be carried across the Detroit River to Canada or other hiding places in Michigan. Finney's son and Underground Railroad participants identified Finney's Barn as a key station in the region in the decade before the Civil War. Finney embraced the Free-Soil, and then Republican Party. In 1864, retired from the hotel business, Finney publicly lectured for racial equality. As early as 1878, Finney's Barn was described in Michigan history books as a station on the Underground Railroad. Despite its historical significance, the barn was razed for the Detroit Chamber of Commerce building in 1892. Today that building bears an historical plaque presented September 1926 by the City of Detroit, designating the site as \"Detroit's Underground Railway Station\". On January 23, 1980, the State of Michigan placed a historic marker opposite the current Griswold St. building entrance commemorating the Finney Barn site."

While his role as a conductor has been recognized at various locations throughout the United States, Brown called this Akron residence \"home\" for the better part of a decade between 1844 and 1854 and he spent the majority of his life living in Summit County, Ohio. It was in conjunction with his employment in the wool trade, here, that Brown traveled to Springfield, Massachusetts where he became more involved abolitionism and the Underground Railroad.\n\nAs a result of this experience, when Brown returned to Akron his Underground Railroad activities became more aggressive.\n\nSince 1971, the home has been owned operated by The Summit County Historical Society (SCHS), whose responsibility is to tell the story of Brown's life in Akron and his involvement in the Underground Railroad during residency at the house.\n\n"

The county had a number of known stations and was also home to renowned abolitionist and Underground Railroad activist, John Brown, for much of his life\n\nThe trunk, which is available as a free resource from the Summit County Historical Society (SCHS), located in Akon, Ohio, allows users to interact with this history in a tangible way. It contains primary sources, secondary sources, picture books, photographs and reproduction materials such as documents, maps, clothing, artifacts and a cotton gin. It is also accompanied with lesson plans, vocabulary words, classroom activities and curriculum designed by area social studies teacher, which meet the Ohio Academic Standards and Benchmarks for 3rd, 4th, 5th, 8th, and 10th grades.\n\n"

    "ABSTRACT":"In 2007, the City of Sandusky, Ohio dedicated the \"Path to Freedom\", an interpretive sculpture, located in Facer Park, that commemorates the city's important role in the Underground Railroad. The life-sized sculpture, by Susan Schultz, depicts a slave family's (man, woman, and child) flight to freedom. Informational plaques that surround the sculpture memorialize participants, black and white, enslaved and free that contributed to the Sandusky's evolution as a terminus of the Underground Railroad.\n\nThe sculpture's location, 50 yards from Sandusky Bay, is symbolic of Sandusky's strategic waterfront location, where only Lake Erie separated fugitive slaves from true freedom on the Canadian mainland, a mere 35 miles north of Sandusky.\n\nSandusky's role in Underground Railroad activities is well documented. Levi Coffin, President of the Underground Railroad, revealed that Sandusky was an important route to freedom. Harriet Beecher Stowe referenced Sanduskyin the fictional but based on historical fact, \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\", released in 1852. In 1854, in two separate legal cases, the federal government tried noted Sandusky abolitionist Rush Sloane for violating the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act for orchestrating an escape of captured slaves. However, these incidences barely touch the surface of Sandusky's relevance to the Underground Railroad."

    "ABSTRACT":"First presented in 2012, the educational youth program, Waynesville's Role in the Underground Railroad, is presented each year to the sixth grade students at the Waynesville Middle School in Waynesville, Ohio. Designed by the Waynesville Underground Railroad Committee (WURC), the interactive program builds upon the sixth grade language arts and social studies curriculum and includes PowerPoint lecture, walking tour, and trip to Camp Joy, an outdoor educational camp, near Clarksville, Ohio where students participate in a living history re-enactment of the Underground Railroad Movement. The program builds upon existing historical sites, some of which are listed on the National Register, and historical documents, including the 1840 Miami Monthly Meeting Minutes and letters from the Wilbur Siebert Collection, to explore how Waynesville, settled by Quakers from the Bush River (South Carolina) Quaker Meeting who were committed to anti-slavery principles, was an important stop on the Underground Railroad."

    "ABSTRACT":"This house at 617-27th Street was the law office and last primary residence of James Apostles Fields from 1897 until his death in 1903. Fields was born a slave in Hanover County, Virginia in 1844. At the age of 17, he escaped slavery and eluded capture for 11 €œ12 months by first hiding in the countryside of Hanover County and then in the city of Richmond, Virginia. He was recaptured but made his final escape to freedom behind the lines of the Union army in late 1862. He served as a guide for the Federals until 1864 when he rejoined his family, who had also escaped to freedom as \"contraband of war,\" at Fort Monroe. Fields was in the first graduating class of Hampton Normal and Agricultural School (now Hampton University) in 1871. He was the first black judicial officer in Warwick County (now Newport News). In 1881, Fields graduated from the Howard University Law School in Washington, D.C. He became a successful teacher, lawyer, politician and property owner. This property represents Mr. Fields at the height of his success and epitomizes his rise from slavery to freedom."

    "ABSTRACT":"The subaqueous land off the coast of the southernmost mile of unimproved beach on Tangier Island in Accomack County, Virginia, is nominated for certification as a site on the Underground Railroad Network to Freedom. This subaqueous land would have been beach property above the water line during Tangier Island's significance to the Underground Railroad. Nearly 1,000 slaves would have arrived on this stretch of beach from April 1814 to March 1815 during the War of 1812, escaping bondage from nearby plantations and destined for Fort Albion, maintained by the British at this site as a naval depot and haven for escaped American slaves. Recruiting escaped slaves was a common military tactic for the British during the War of 1812, and Tangier Island was selected to house a naval station because of its proximity to the numerous slave plantations in Tidewater Virginia and eastern Maryland. Today, there are no structures that remain on Tangier Island from its period of significance to the Underground Railroad, and the site being nominated for certification is primarily an archaeological site and cultural landscape. Tangier Island is affiliated with the Star-Spangled Banner National Historic Trail."

    "ABSTRACT":"Established in 1856, Oakdale Memorial Gardens,an integrated cemetery in Davenport, Iowa, is the final resting place of eleven freedom seekers: Jacob (1857-1913), Matilda (1822-1899), and Nancy (1855-1871) Busey;Moses Bush (c. 1840s-1921);Mary Busey-Ford (1844-1903);Silas Hopkins (c. 1833-1915);General Houston (1840-1910);Milton Howard (d. 1928);Pernicia Busey-Marshall (1848-1925);Henry McGaw (d. 1915);and Linsey Pitts (d.1913). These men and women, like many others, escaped slavery and made their way north to freedom. Many of these freedom seekers settled in Davenport where they lived the rest of their lives as important leaders of the black community and were eventually laid to rest at Oakdale Cemetery.\nThe cemetery is open to the public from dusk until dawn daily. The office is open from 9:00 am to 4:00 pm on weekdays-including some holidays.\n\n"

    "ABSTRACT":"This nomination includes the Wittemberg Church and Cemetery, representative landmarks of the Wittemberg Community, in Section 3 of Newton Township, Jasper County, IA, which served as a sanctuary for escaped slaves in the 1850s and 1860s.On December 18, 1855, the pioneers here, largely proponents of the Free Presbyterian faith, established the Wittemberg Manual Labor College, a Western technical school for the teaching of agriculture, mechanical arts, and domestic science. Any student or shareholder regardless of class, race, or gender who was not a slaveholder was welcomed.According to Milton Alexander \"Milt\" McCord (1845-1929), whose father was instrumental in the UGRR in Newton, and who was himself involved in UGRR activity at the age of 13, there were 28 escaped slaves in Newton, the county seat of Jasper County, in 1861-62.\"They found refuge on the farms near Wittemburg [sic],\" he recalled, \"the Moyer, Vanatta, Kirk and Merrill farms.\" The people of the Wittemberg Community fed and sheltered these freedom seekers, took them in their charge, and taught them farming techniques. At least four of this number, John Ross Miller (1841-1923), Alexander Nichols (?-1864), Anderson Hays (1836-1923), and Henderson Hays (?-1864), would go on to fight in the Civil War.\n\nThe cemetery is open from sun up to sun down."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Graves et al. v. State of Indiana Historical Marker in Bristol (Elkhart County), installed in 2007, acknowledges an 1847 fugitive slave case. In 1846, an enslaved man named Thomas Harris escaped from the Boone County, Kentucky plantation of Joseph Graves. By 1847, Harris was working in Bristol, Indiana for Samuel Judson.Graves learned of Harris' location and went there with two bounty hunters to retrieve him.Graves received an arrest warrant from the Justice of the Peace and broke into the home of Harris' employer in order to capture Harris;Harris was taken before a different Justice of the Peace, who discharged him on the grounds that the warrant was insufficient. Graves and the two bounty hunters, Elisha E. Coleman and Hugh P. Longmore, were indicted on a charge of riot for the commotion they caused during the arrest.The trial judge instructed the jury that the warrant issued by the first Justice of the Peace was void because Indiana state law mandated that Graves should have requested the warrant from the clerk of a circuit court.After their guilty conviction, the defendants appealed to the Indiana Supreme Court, which ruled that the judge's instruction was in error and therefore overturned the guilty verdict."

The Eastern Shore landscape fills this historical gap because it is the artifact that remains to evoke this history and provide an important historical context to understand what it meant to travel on the Underground Railroad. Participants will learn about the connection between preserved Chesapeake Bay landscapes and historic conditions and events, as well as the importance of preserving natural landscapes to provide a context for history.\n\nWith its forests, thickets, marshes, rivers and creeks, the Eastern Shore's natural landscape provided a passageway to freedom along the Underground Railroad for hundreds, and possibly thousands of slaves, including abolitionists Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman. Designated as a \"Place to Visit\" on the Harriet Tubman Byway, Adkins Arboretum reflects the conditions through which slaves traveled en route to freedom, and serves as a dramatic vista to experience the little-known relationship between nature and the Underground Railroad."

    "ABSTRACT":" The US Army Corps of Engineers currently owns and operates the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal. This canal, built in 1829 by investors, provided a route for freedom seekers on steamboats, schooners, and other water craft. Boats entered at Elk River in Cecil County, Maryland, and exited at Delaware City, New Castle County, Delaware. This eliminated approximately 300 nautical miles between Baltimore and Philadelphia. This Chesapeake Bay to Delaware River route to Philadelphia was also safer for smaller watercraft than a voyage into the Atlantic Ocean and Delaware Bay. William Still and Sydney Gay recorded escapes on steamboats and schooners passing through the canal. Local newspapers reported unsuccessful canal-related escapes, and complained about suspicious Philadelphia oyster boats assisting escapes. When some freedom seekers fled from the lower Eastern Shore, a newspaper commented that the close watch kept on the canal would make it difficult for them to pass that way."

    "ABSTRACT":" Dugan's Wharf: Site of Tilly Escape is now known as Pier 4 and the site of the National Aquarium's Mammal Pavilion. On October 21, Harriet Tubman helped a young woman named \"Tilly\" flee enslavement in Baltimore, Maryland. Unable to safely bring Tilly to Philadelphia via a northeasterly route, Tubman cleverly devised a scheme to take Tilly south, via the steamboat \"Kent\" to Seaford, Delaware. The steamer \"Kent\" docked at Dugan's Wharf in Baltimore' Inner Harbor, which is now the site of the National Aquarium Mammal Pavilion at Pier 4. During the 1850s, the Kent made weekly round trip excursions to the Eastern Shore of Maryland, carrying mail, freight and passengers up and down the Chesapeake Bay and several of its Eastern Shore tributaries, including the Choptank and Nanticoke Rivers. Once the two women arrived in Seaford, Tubman and Tilly took the newly established Delaware Railroad to Camden, eventually finding their way to Wilmington, where Underground Railroad agent Thomas Garrett documented their arrival and helped them on to Philadelphia and freedom. Tilly's story is also celebrated in Seaford, DE, and there is now a Network to Freedom site at Gateway Park along the Nanticoke River where the former steamboat landing and hotel once stood."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Hays-Heighe House is associated with the Underground Railroad because \"Sam\" Archer escaped enslavement by Thomas Hays and revealed his experience with the Hays family to William Still, who documented it in his seminal book, \"The Underground Railroad\". Sam escaped to Pennsylvania in 1860, prior to Elizabeth Jacobs' pending official inheritance in 1861.\n\nArcher Hays was the original owner of Prospect Hill Farm, now the site of Harford Community College in Bel Air, Maryland. He is credited with building the main family dwelling, what we now call the Hays-Heighe House, in 1808. A well established and prosperous farmer, amongst his property holdings, Archer claimed humans--enslaved Africans, or \"Negroes,\" as chattel. Thomas Archer Hays, Sr., eldest son of Archer and Hanna inherited Prospect Hill Farm, as well as a portion of his father's chattel. Thomas was a wealthy lawyer and business owner who became recognized as \"the father of Bel Air,\" the Harford County seat. In 1859, prior to his 1861 death, Hays drafted a will that divided his assets among his children and brother, Nathaniel. His heirs also inherited \"Negroes.\" On such \"Negro\" was \"Sam.\" Hays willed Prospect Hill and Sam to his daughter Elizabeth (Hays) Jacobs."

This building, located near the corner of Mercer Street and County Street, was used from 1840 through the fall term of 1842 while the permanent courthouse structure was being constructed on nearby Court Avenue on Capitoline Hill. Although the courthouse was never moved, the streets around the courthouse were moved/changed in the urban renewal of the 1960s.\n\nOne case involved four slaves -- Bill Plummer, John Wesley Mathews, David Mathews, and Basil all of whom belonged to Charles D. Warfield. The slaves were charged with illegally absconding from their master to Pennsylvania. Subsequently free black Wesley Green was charged for helping the four slaves escape to Pennsylvania."

The Courthouse was designed and built of native granite between 1840 and 1843, and is located high atop Capitoline Hill above Main Street in Ellicott City. Arguably, the most famous case involved the transfer of known Underground Railroad agent William L. Chaplin of New York from Montgomery County to Howard County in 1850, but there were many cases involving local free Blacks like that of Warner Cook, charged with enticing slaves to run away."

    "ABSTRACT":" The Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Baltimore Railroad Steam Ferry Landing site in Perryville, Maryland, at the mouth of the Susquehanna River, is relevant to resistance to slavery. The site is associated with famous and lesser known escapes, and one kidnapping and rescue of a free Pennsylvania citizen. At the Susquehanna River, trains stopped in Havre de Grace, passengers and cars crossed on the railroad ferry, and resumed their journey from the Perryville station. Frederick Douglass escaped on this railroad in 1838, and the Crafts in 1848. Charlotte Giles and Harriet Eglin escaped from Baltimore on this railroad. Henry \"Box\" Brown was freighted across on the ferry in 1859. Rachel Parker was kidnapped on the last day of 1851 by Thomas McCreary, who Frederick Douglass and other abolitionists referred to as \"the notorious kidnapper from Elkton.\" Part of the drama of her abduction, her rescue, and her pleas for freedom unfolded at Perryville. In 1853 Aaron Digges, fleeing from a Baltimore butcher, entered the train at the Susquehanna crossing, but he fell into the hands of Constable Thomas McCreary. In 1854, Henry fled from John Stump, who owned the land at Perry Point, by taking the train out of Perryville."

Moses Grandy was enslaved in Camden County, NC and purchased his freedom circa 1830 after trying three times. His life story is documented in his 1843 slave narrative entitled “Narrative of the Life of Moses Grandy: Late A Slave in the United States of America.”Moses’ narrative is the only written account from a slave who helped build the Dismal Swamp Canal, and UGRR site. Charles Grandy was enslaved in Hickory Ground (Chesapeake), Virginia. At age 20, Charles fled his plantation via the UGRR and gained his freedom as a Contraband slave at Fort Monroe in 1862. Charles Grandy’s life story is documented in the 1937 Federal Writer’s Program narrative entitled “Interview of Mr. Charles Grandy, Ex-slave and Civil War Veteran.” Tour sites include the Dismal Swamp Canal (NC/VA), Moses Grandy Trail (Chesapeake) Fort Monroe (Hampton VA), James River, Norfolk waterfront, Moses Myers House (Norfolk VA) and Emanuel AME Church (Portsmouth VA)."

    "ABSTRACT":"The town of Washington is situated on the Tar-Pamlico River in eastern North Carolina. Shipbuilding and the transportation of products to and from Washington on the river provided work for skilled enslaved and free blacks, and an embarkation site for enslaved people to escape from the Washington waterfront. In approximately forty-three slave runaway newspaper advertisements in \"Stealing a Little Freedom: Advertisements for Slave Runaways in North Carolina, 1791-1840\" edited by historian Freddie L. Parker, slave owners speculated that slaves were traveling to and from Washington to escape by vessel, visit family, or hide among free blacks. The authentic narratives of William Still document the escape of a man who hid out on a ship traveling from Washington to Philadelphia."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Hemingford Cemetery in Hemingford, Nebraska is the resting place of Robert Ball Anderson (1843-1930), a freedom seeker, soldier, homesteader, farmer, and prominent land owner. In 1864 Robert Ball Anderson escaped enslavement by fleeing his owner's plantation in Kentucky. He enlisted in the Union army at the nearest recruiting station and joined the 125th United States Colored Infantry. Although he did not fight against the Confederacy, he saw service on the western frontier. Anderson mustered out in 1867 and began a long journey to become one of the most successful African American landowners in Nebraska. Failure, setback and hardships continuously confronted him. However, self-reliance, intelligence, thriftiness, generosity and an affable personality allowed him to become a prominent figure in a predominately white environment. Anderson became an integral part of his community, and he represented a beacon of hope on the frontier for African Americans. He acquired wealth and thousands of acres and eventually married at the age of 79 Anderson. He enjoyed eight years with his young bride, Daisy Anderson before tragically dying from injuries sustained in a car accident on November 30, 1930.\n\nHemingford Cemetery is open to the public from Sunup to Sundown.\n"

    "ABSTRACT":"Charles Cheney (1803-1874), conductor on the Underground Railroad, once owned a 90 acre farm which now is occupied by Heritage Park in in Mt. Healthy, Ohio. Cheney provided shelter and transportation assistance to freedom seekers during the years that he lived in Mt. Pleasant, Ohio (now called Mt. Healthy): 1837 - 1846. His farm bordered the Hamilton Road, a route that connected Cincinnati to Hamilton, Ohio and was one of the early roads leading north from Cincinnati.By virtue of living along a major transportation route north out of Cincinnati, Cheney had the opportunity to assist freedom seekers. His many local connections and his involvement with the Liberty Party also brought him into contact with abolitionists such as the Carys, Salmon P. Chase, and Gamaliel Bailey. His role as the president of the Cincinnati and Hamilton Turnpike Company allowed him to be well acquainted with allies along the route. Direct evidence of his involvement in the Underground Railroad comes through various sources, including his own letters."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Kirby Avenue Corridor in Cincinnati, now a paved city street, was a route of escape for 28 freedom seekers in 1853. The 2.7 mile steep, wooded, dirt drovers' track was a back way into College Hill, a community with abolitionist history, linking it to the neighborhood of Cumminsville (now Northside) to its south. Bypassing the main toll road of Hamilton Avenue, this path provided indirect access into College Hill; neither improved nor tolled because it was so isolated.  It also led to several of the farms of College Hill.  This group of 28 escaping freedom seekers left Boone Co., Kentucky, crossing the Ohio River near Lawrenceburg, Indiana. Led from Kentucky by abolitionist John Fairfield to downtown Cincinnati, they met there with Levi Coffin and other abolitionists. The group was disguised as a funeral cortege going to the city's only integrated cemetery, Wesleyan, in Cumminsville.  The buggies and coaches carrying them skirted Wesleyan Cemetery and went up to College Hill by this back route. The group was hidden by sympathetic community members, and sent on their way to the next station. Their escape from Kentucky into Canada was recorded by Levi Coffin in his book, <em>Reminiscences of Levi Coffin\".\n\n</em>"

Because of Sloane's highly visible action on October 1852 to aid fugitives in their escape to Canada and his believed willingness to seclude freedom seekers, his home is being nominated to memorialize his prominent participation on the Underground Railroad\n\nIn 1854, Sloane appeared in U. S. District Court, accused by two Kentucky slaveholders for assisting seven freedom seekers escape on October 20, 1852, , thus violating the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act. The court acquitted Sloane in \"Gibbons v. Sloane\", but found him guilty in \"Weimer v. Sloane\". The court fined Sloane $3000, plus court costs.\n\nAlthough a staunch abolitionist, Sloane remains most well-known for the prominent court case. He was one of the first individuals to be prosecuted in Ohio for violating the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act, and only one of two initiated in Erie County, Ohio.\n\nIn 1854, Rush Sloane purchased a home at 403 E. Adams Street , which he owned until his death. In 1975, the home was placed on the National Register. Currently, it is privately owned."

    "ABSTRACT":"At the southeast corner of 3rd and Main Streets in Cincinnati, Ohio, a plaque was erected commemorating the location of Salmon P. Chase's law office, which stood across the street. During Chase's time working from his office on the northeast corner of 3rd and Main (1830-1858), he established himself as a defender of freedom seekers, earning the nickname \"Attorney General for Escaped Slaves.\" Chase pioneered the argument against the constitutionality of the Fugitive Slave Act, using it most famously in the cases of Matilda (1837), \"Ohio v. Birney\"(1837), and \"Jones v. Van Zandt\"(1847). He was also involved in the defense of several other freedom seekers throughout his career. Chase would eventually take his battle against slavery to public office, being elected to the Senate and Governor of Ohio, and appointed to President Lincoln's Cabinet as Secretary of the Treasury. Later still, Chase would be appointed Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, using his power in all of these offices to combat slavery.\n\nThe marker was placed in 2003 by the Ohio Bicentennial Commission, the Scotts Company, and the Ohio Historical Society."

Chase, Levi and Catharine Coffin, John and Elizabeth Coleman, Edward Harwood, and Samuel and Sally Wilson.\n\nCincinnati inevitably became a destination for freedom seekers because of its close proximity to the Ohio River and the slave state of Kentucky. Citizens of Cincinnati eventually became active in the Underground Railroad and assisted countless freedom seekers break the bonds of slavery.  Individual contributions to Cincinnati's Underground Railroad have been well documented in letters, reminiscences, newspaper articles, books, and the Wilbur H.

    "ABSTRACT":"Founded February 9, 1843, Wesleyan Cemetery, located in Cincinnati and among the oldest cemeteries still in contiguous operation in Hamilton County, Ohio, is recognized as the first cemetery in the area that permitted black and white burials at the same grounds. The site is noted for its connection with the Underground Railroad as the final resting place of abolitionist John Van Zandt and as being significantly instrumental in the successful and well documented \"Escape of the 28 Slaves\".\n\nJohn Van Zandt was a former slave owner in Kentucky who freed his slaves, moved to Glendale, Ohio, and actively participated in the Underground Railroad. In 1842, he was captured while transporting escaped slaves north from Cincinnati, was tried and found guilty for disobeying the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793.  The case eventually went before the Supreme Court.  On April 2, 1853, 28 slaves, led\nby John Fairfield, left Boone County, Kentucky, escaped across the Ohio River near Lawrenceburg, Indiana, and trekked to Cincinnati, Ohio. There they met abolitionists Levi Coffin and Deacon\nJohn Hatfield.  Disguised as members of a funeral cortege going to Wesleyan Cemetery in Cumminsville, their procession skirted Wesleyan and proceeded northward.  Assisted at many different stations en-route;\n28 safely arrived in Canada. "

    "ABSTRACT":"The Zion Baptist Church Congregation of Cincinnati, Ohio assisted freedom seekers on their journey to freedom, and as such is being nominated for inclusion to the Network to Freedom.  Zion, an African American Church, was established in 1842 by Wallace Shelton, a formerly enslaved man, along with members of the Union Baptist Church.  The Congregation was first located downtown on Plum Street (1842-1867), but was later relocated to 9th street (1867-1961), and in 1961 the church relocated to its present location on Glenwood Avenue. From 1842 to 1865, the congregation hid, fed, and clothed numerous freedom seekers and welcomed them into their midst. The church itself also served as a station, as freedom seekers were regularly hidden in the church's basement. Individuals associated with the church's Underground Railroad activities include John Hatfield, a deacon at the church who assisted in the escape of the 28; Laura Haviland a Quaker and conductor of the Underground Railroad in Michigan, who while teaching at the church, helped feed and clothe freedom seekers; as well as lesser known individuals who were either ministers or members of the church. "

    "ABSTRACT":"The extant piers and abutment of the Columbia-Wrightsville Bridge, and nearby ruins of locks of the Pennsylvania Canal along the Susquehanna River are being nominated as the remains of three major transportation facilities at the riverfront in Columbia, Lancaster County, PA which provided the means of flight for thousands of freedom seekers, circa 1830.When in operation, these facilities included a massive, wooden covered bridge spanning the Susquehanna River, which connected with one of the nation's earliest railroads, and the adjacent canal system.Opposite this industrial riverfront stood many of the town's homes and commercial establishments where white abolitionists and free Africans provided shelter, employment and other support.This early inter-related transportation network became a well-known hub of Underground Railroad activity. From here, the formerly enslaved could travel east to Philadelphia, north to Harrisburg, the state capital, as well as west to Pittsburgh. This activity was a continuation of  transportation history that began with river crossings here in 1734, while anti-slavery activities can be traced to about 1800.This community sentiment became widely known, such that in the period 1815-20, Southern plantation owners freed hundreds at Columbia, encouraging many more to follow this path for decades to come.\n"

    "ABSTRACT":"The Longwood Progressive Friends Meeting House and Longwood Cemetery, located in Chester County, PA, is a remarkable, living testament to the struggle to abolish slavery and to the pursuit of liberty and equality for all individuals. Members were involved in sheltering and protecting Harriet Sheppard and her five children who fled their enslaver from Kent County, MD. Founding member Thomas Garrett used his numerous religious, social, and family connections to support his busy UGRR stop in Wilmington, DE. Twenty-eight freedom seekers from Dorchester County, MD, arrived in Kennett, PA, and were separated and sent to different members of Longwood. Many eventually made it to Canada. Harriet Tubman also stopped and worked with members of Longwood on her trips from MD.Another founding member, Mahon Linton, provided shelter to Sam Turner and Wesley Jones from Chestertown, MD. Elijah Pennypacker sheltered Tom Castle and Ezekiel Chambers. Joseph Dugdale was a stationmaster who also protected Lucya Garrett, who escaped from the western shore of Virginia. Many important local participants in the Underground Railroad and other anti-slavery activities, including John and Hannah Cox, Eusebius Barnard, and Isaac and Dinah Mendenhall are buried in Longwood cemetery across from the meetinghouse."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Anthony Allen Site, Honolulu, Hawaii, is now Washington Middle School at the corner of Punahou and South King Streets, and is owned by the city. Anthony Allen (1774-1835) was a slave who sought freedom. From enslavement in Schenectady, New York, he made his way by land to Hartford, and by sea to Boston. He was hired as a steward for seven years and cook for one year under the same captain. Faced with recapture in 1806, he bought his freedom with help from the ship's owner who let him pay back over time the money demanded. After many adventures and seeing the world, Allen left the sea to make the Hawaiian Islands his home in 1812, because men of African descent could reside there without harassment from slavers. Allen served as a steward and confidante to Hawaiian King Kamehameha the Great. The High Priest Hewahewa invited him to live in his home. In 1811 he gave him six acres near Waikiki where he would establish a home and business, catering to the local royalty, chiefs, and visiting ships' crews. The major sources for Allen's story are an 1822 letter written to his former master's son and accounts by missionaries."

The home was passed down to John Speed's son, Robert Bruce, after his death in 1873, and it stood on the land purchased by the Speeds until the 1930s. A large part of the Speed home was demolished in the early 1930s, but the cabin was rescued and moved to Milligan Park. In 1990, the cabin was moved to its current home on the grounds of Lane Place, the home of the Montgomery County Historical Society. The historical marker at North and Grant Streets, the original site of the cabin, was dedicated in 1995 by the Indiana Historical Bureau and the Montgomery County Community Foundation."

    "ABSTRACT":"Richard Potter Rescue Celebration Site is the location of the former hotel where Richard Potter was brought after he was rescued from being kidnapped in 1853. This site is relevant to the Underground Railroad as it is the place where Richard Potter's freedom began. In 1853, African American and white residents celebrated the rescue and return of Richard John Potter, a free black youth who had been kidnapped from Greensboro, Caroline County, MD and sold into slavery to Delaware. Born free around 1838 in Greensboro, Richard was indentured in 1848 by his mother, Sydney Potter, to Batchelder C. Skinner, a farmer living near Greensboro.Finding that he no longer could use Richard's labor, Skinner leased him, illegally, to Edward Taylor, another farmer near Greensboro, sometime around 1852.Taylor was cruel and abusive.When Richard's parents sued in court to cancel their son's indenture, Taylor schemed to sell Potter as a slave.In a trap set by Taylor, Potter was kidnapped from Taylor's farm and sold to a man named Vaughn, who lived near Concord, in Sussex, DE. With search parties hot on Potter's trail, Vaughn decided to kill him.Fortunately, young Richard fled from the Vaughn home and found refuge with a sympathetic neighbour, Mrs. Short.Potter was rescued and brought back to Denton, Caroline Co. While resting on the steps of the local hotel on Courthouse Square, he was greeted by his joyful parents and cheering crowds. Potter's indenture, kidnapping, and rescue is vividly documented in his memoir, \"The Narrative of the Experience, Adventures, and Escape of Richard Potter,\" first published in 1866. The site nominated includes the former hotel site where he was feted upon his return. The site was the former location of Denton's only hotel on the town square in 1853. The hotel site is now the current location of a 20th century bank building.\n\nFour sites associated with Richard John Potter, who was kidnapped from near Greensboro, Caroline County, Maryland in 1853 and sold i"

    "ABSTRACT":"St. Matthews Episcopal Church, located in Detroit, Michigan, is one of the nation's oldest African American churches. This small but historic parish community has been one of Detroit's most influential and highly respected institutions. Founded in 1846, the church was a center of abolitionist and Underground Railroad in the 19th century. This was in large part because of its early leadership. Underground Railroad activists, William Lambert and Rev. William Monroe, who had left Second Baptist for reasons unknown, were involved with St. Matthews since its founding. Both men were leaders of Detroit's African American community and documented Underground Railroad activists, instrumental in the Colored Vigilant Committee of Detroit. Rev. James Theodore Holly was ordained as deacon of the church in 1855, and a priest in 1856. Holly had previously worked with Henry Bibb in Canada publishing the \"Voice of the Fugitive\", a black anti-slavery newspaper which reported on Underground Railroad related activities. He also encouraged free and enslaved blacks to participate in the Underground Railroad by immigrating to Canada.\n\nMembers of the church, such as George J. Reynolds (aka J.G. Reynolds) and Robert Banks were also active in the Underground Railroad. It is also maintained that many freedom seekers were among the congregation of the church, as evidence shows that the church's population dwindled after the passage of the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act.\n\nThe church has occupied various locations throughout its history and has been at its current location since merging with St. Joseph's Episcopal Church in 1971."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Roanoke Canal's level towpath and its location near the Roanoke River, Halifax, North Carolina, and the Great Dismal Swamp made it an effective escape route for freedom seekers. The 7.8 mile Roanoke Canal Trail is being nominated to the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom.David S. Cecelski, historian and author of the book \"The Waterman's Song\", explained in his book that slaves escaped often from the canal building camps located around the Roanoke Canal and Aqueduct. The Roanoke Navigation Company owned many slaves during the construction of the canal.The Roanoke River is\nalready a part of the National Underground Railroad Network, and the only way boats would have been able to travel it would be by using the Roanoke Canal.Batteux men were also slaves who were given the freedom to operate their own ships.According to Cecelski's book, batteux men would hide slaves on their boats and transport them to freedom.Cecelski cites runaway slave ads in some of the local newspapers, including the \"Carolina Observer, Edenton Gazette,\" and the \"Halifax Minerva\".The Roanoke Canal now operates as a Museum and Trail. Since 1976, the trail is owned by The Roanoke Canal Commission and the Museum is operated by the City of Roanoke Rapids, NC."

    "ABSTRACT":"Woodland Cemetery, established in 1851, located in Cleveland, Ohio is the final resting place of four individuals that were involved in the Underground Railroad:\n\n1.  Sara Lucy Bagby (Johnson) (c. 1843-1906):  A freedom seeker who escaped in October 1860 from Wheeling, VA to  Cleveland, OH.  However, her whereabouts were uncovered by her owner, William Gorshorn, and after a trial in January of 1861, she was returned to slavery. She is recognized as one of the last freedom seekers to be returned to the south under the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act.\n2.  John Brown (c. 1798-1869):  A wealthy African American Clevelander. Brown, who was free-born, was an abolitionist and Underground Railroad activist. His home and shop both served as stations on the Underground Railroad.\n3.  Edward Wade (1803-1866):  A staunch abolitionist and a member of the U. S. House of Representative, he was a conductor and station master for the Underground Railroad.  Edward helped transport freedom seekers to Cleveland to move onward to freedom in Canada.  He also was one of six signatures that opposed the Nebraska-Kansas Act.\n4.  Hiram Wilson (1803-1864):  A Lane Rebel, who was a devoted missionary to freedom seekers and an Underground Railroad activist in Canada."

    "ABSTRACT":"In 1994, the Sandusky Area Maritime Association, Inc. was formed by local Sanduskians and they established a 503 (c)(3) non-profit museum called the Maritime Museum Of Sandusky in Ohio.  The museum's mission is: \"To collect, preserve, research, exhibit and interpret the maritime heritage of the Sandusky Area, including Port Clinton to and including Huron, the Lake Erie Islands and South to and including the Milan area.\"  In fulfilling its mission, the museum features an educational program, \"Boats of Sandusky's Underground Railroad\", which consists of an exhibit, documentary film, PowerPoint program, and traveling educational trunk.\n\nThe subject of the local efforts of abolitionists involved in the Underground Railroad is an important part of the maritime history of the area, because for many escaping slaves, Sandusky was their last stop before securing boat travel to Canada.  Both white and black Sanduskians helped many runaways with food, shelter, and passage onto one of the many boats that were docked in the Sandusky Bay.  Sandusky's large navigable harbor made a natural port for many ships including fishing boats, passenger , cargo ships.   It was one of the best locations to secure boat travel to Canada, which was the primary goal of many runaways passing through town.  The museum's previous exhibit from 2003 and the newly constructed exhibit, which was completed in 2013, share the same name, \"Boats of Sandusky's Underground Railroad\".  It is a reflective, informational exhibit that is designed to resemble one of Sandusky's old boat docks.  The 10-minute documentary that was filmed in the summer of 2013, Sandusky Maritime , the Underground Railroad, was produced to coordinate with the exhibit and is shown twice daily in the museum's auditorium. The museum also has an Underground Railroad PowerPoint program and an educational trunk that are great for traveling programs and are classroom-appropriate, as they come accompanied with lesson plans designed for 3rd-5th"

    "ABSTRACT":"The Heritage Library is a premier ancestry and local history research center located on Hilton Head Island, SC.Information is available on the island's history from the earliest known inhabitants through the modern era. It is an all-volunteer member organization dedicated to the promotion of local history and the study of genealogy.\n\nDuring the Civil War, Hilton Head Island was captured early in the conflict by Union forces on November 7, 1861, in the Battle of Port Royal, and the island became the Headquarters of the Department of the South, tasked with blockading Confederate vessels along the coast of the Carolinas, Georgia and northern Florida.The island became a protective haven for many of the contraband slaves from the island plantations as well as from the mainland of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.With Union assistance, the contrabands established Mitchelville, the first self-governing freedman village in the United States.\n\nThe library has discovered many of the stories of these contrabands through our research of the people of Mitchelville, and of the pensions of the United States Colored Troops from Hilton Head.One such story is about March Haines, born enslaved in Pocataligo, South Carolina, and as a young man was hired out as a boat pilot and stevedore. Eventually, he became a carpenter at Ft. Pulaski.Once freed under\nMajor-General David Hunter's orders, Haines became active in the war effort.He secreted a boat near Savannah and brought a large number of freedom seekers to Hilton Head, eventually settling himself and his wife in Mitchelville. He became a soldier of the 21 Regiment of the United States Colored Troops, and eventually was elected the\nmarshal of Mitchelville."

    "ABSTRACT":"Buckland Farm straddles Prince William and Fauquier Counties in Virginia. It was a site of escapes from slavery beginning in 1817. The first farm owner for whom there are documented escapes was John Love (1750-1834). John Love inherited slaves from his father Samuel. He owned 12-21 slaves during the 1790s through 1820. Love is paradoxical, since he helped and defended free African Americans but also enslaved other African Americans like Jane and Robin who felt compelled to resist by escape. As Love, an attorney in Alexandria and Fauquier County, became successively State Delegate, US Congressman, and State Senator, he used overseers at Buckland Farm. One, his nephew Richard Hendley Love, in 1817 advertised for freedom seeker Robin. The nephew later advertised for Jane Williams a \"runaway\" who sued for her freedom, but was jailed and escaped in the District of Columbia in 1818. Another overseer who lived on the estate was Griffin Stith who advertised in 1821 for Toby who escaped while being held during a lawsuit.\n\nThe next owner of Buckland Farm was Love's cousin Temple Mason Washington. From him Washington Hayes and Ariadne Taylor escaped in 1842 and Thornton escape in 1853."

When brought back to Washington, Kitty and her children were jailed.\n\nKitty was the mulatto daughter of her owner, Samuel Maddox and one of his slaves.When Maddox died in 1837, he bequeathed his whole estate to his wife, Mary Maddox.Included in this estate were all of his slaves including Kitty and her four children.Mary Maddox emancipated all of the slaves 23 February 1843 by court action.In May 1843, Mary Maddox left VA with the slaves and traveled to Pennsylvania settling them in that free state.Maddox's will specified that upon death of his wife, any remaining property would go to a nephew, Samuel, Jr. who claimed ownership of Kitty. In August of 1845, he had Kitty and her children captured and returned to Rappahannock County.Once there however, Kitty challenged Samuel in court, claiming her freedom.While the proceedings dragged on for nearly a year, Kitty and her children were incarcerated in the County Jail \"for their safekeeping\". "

    "ABSTRACT":"The Old Jail in Warrenton on Courthouse Square served as Fauquier County's detention center for over 150 years. In the complex there is an 1808 brick jail, and an 1823 stone jail with walled yards. Now the Fauquier History Museum, the Old Jail in Warrenton, Virginia, is a rare survival of an early 19th century county jail used for housing enslaved African Americans. It is currently owned by Fauquier County and run as a county historical museum by the Fauquier Historical Society. It is unusual because jail records have survived from 1759, which was when the county was established.\n\nThe jail complex is significant to the Underground Railroad, because it was used to house those captured while attempting to escape slavery. The jail also has housed free people caught without their papers, who risked being sold into slavery. Runaway ads and court records indicate the use of public jails as holding places, showing yet another example of the institutionalization of slavery."

    "ABSTRACT":"Christiansted Harbor and Ft. Christiansvaern, St. Croix, United States Virgin Islands, were the central receiving,  transshipment point, and nexus for the incarceration and torture of Enslaved Africans from 1733-1848.During this time, hundreds of people either incarcerated in the Fort, or brought to Christiansted as enslaved and sold to estates in the interior fled and resisted.The Fort was a central symbol of flight from\nbondage, and the wharf on which it sits was a main departure point for maroons/fugitives seeking freedom.While the dynamic of flight shifted in the period 1733-1848, where sometime freedom seekers from other colonies sought passage through Christiansted, most of the flight was towards Puerto Rico where, after a brief period of bondage, maroon/fugitives could be freed. At least 324 people are known to have arrived in Puerto Rico from Christiansted through \"maritime marronage\" in the period 1733-1848. St. Croix is one of the few islands in the Caribbean colonized continuously from 400 BCE to the present, with intensive European colonization in the 15th-19th Centuries that included the English, French, Dutch, Spanish, and eventually the Danish Royal Crown.Denmark ran the Danish West Indies from\n1680-1917, and occupied St. Croix from 1733-1917.The United States purchased the Danish West Indies and established the U.S. Virgin Islands in 1917 where it still operates the islands as an unincorporated territory of the United States.\n\nThe site is now part of Christiansted National Historic Site, a unit in the National Park Service.\n\n\n"

    "ABSTRACT":"Since 2005, descendants and others have gathered annually at Walter Pierce Park in Washington, D.C., to commemorate the 8,428 African Americans buried there between 1870 and 1890, when it was Mt. Pleasant Plains Cemetery. In the 20th Century, headstones and some (but not all) graves were removed, and the land was sold. It became a city park in 1978.\n\nIn 2005, citizen-activists stopped a planned construction project in the park, citing potential harm to unmarked graves. To identify and protect the graves, a non-invasive archaeological survey was led by Howard University anthropologist Mark Mack. Team historians documented the names of those buried at Mt. Pleasant Plains, revealing some who risked their lives seeking freedom.\n\nThe cemetery was owned by the Colored Union Benevolent Association, whose members included Underground Railroad operatives William Bush and John H. Brent. Buried in the cemetery were: Richard and Ephraim Edmonson, who in 1848 tried to escape slavery on the schooner Pearl, Washington's largest Underground Railroad operation; Luke Carter, a Pearl operative and ally of abolitionist William Chaplin; Dennis Magruder, who escaped slavery in 1814 during the British invasion; William Tolson, Edward Marks, and Lewis Ferguson, who fled slavery in 1863 to join the Union Army; and Dabney and Lucy Ann Walker, who in 1862 left enslavement by crossing into Union lines in Virginia."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Rock Springs Cemetery in Burlington, Iowa is the final resting place of Dr. Edwin James (1797 €œ 1861), an Underground Railroad operative. James is most notable for his direct involvement with the Dick case, the only case in Iowa tried under the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. During the summer of 1855, Dick, a freedom seeker from Missouri, made his way to Burlington. Dick was forwarded on to James, who lived five miles south of town, by Kitty Sandridge, a free African American woman whose home served as an Underground Railroad station. Dick and James then made their way across the Missouri River, only to be intercepted by slave catchers from Missouri and escorted them back to Burlington, where a trial ensued. Dick was later released due to insufficient evidence that he was the runaway slave in question. In response to the event, James published a news article that openly expressed his willingness to help freedom seekers. James lived out the rest of his life in Burlington until his unfortunate death on October 28, 1861.\n\n\n"

    "ABSTRACT":" The Marion Hall site located in Burlington, Iowa, served as the courthouse during a famous fugitive slave court case in 1855. The trial, which was the first and only recorded case in Iowa tried under the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, revolved around a freedom seeker simply referred to as Dick in the records. In 1855, Dick arrived in Burlington, Iowa alone and looking for someone to help him acquire safe passage to his freedom.  Upon arriving in Burlington, Dick was assisted by two residents of Burlington: Catherine \"Kitty\" Sandridge, a free African American women, who had purchased her freedom in the early 1850s and Dr. Edwin James, a known abolitionist and operator of the Underground Railroad.  Dick first found help with Sandridge who brought him to Edwin James.  Upon crossing the Mississippi River, Dick and James were stopped by two slave catchers who accused Dick of being the escaped slave of Thomas Rutherford from Clark County Missouri. A short trial ensued and Dick was given his freedom. The case took place at Marion Hall, which had been built in 1853, and served as the courthouse until 1867. In 1925, Marion Hall was demolished and currently the site is a parking lot."

    "ABSTRACT":"Built in 1852, the house located at 111 S. 8th Street, Burlington, Iowa was the home of the Reverend Doctor William Salter (1821-1910) of the First Congregational Church of Burlington and an Underground Railroad activist. Salter came to Iowa in 1843 as a member of the Iowa Band€œa group of eleven Congregational ministers who set out to establish churches in Iowa. He established his first church in Maquoketa in Jackson County, and was later invited to be the pastor of the Burlington church in 1846. He remained the pastor at the church of Burlington for 64 years. During that time, Salter was known for his anti-slavery views, and was referred to as the \"Abolition Preacher.\" On more than one occasion, Rev. Salter assisted freedom seekers, and also assisted a large group of \"contraband\" during the Civil War. Salter also was involved in an incident in Illinois, where he successfully dispersed a group of slave catchers trying to kidnap two free African American men. He lived at his home until his death in 1910. Currently, the house is a private residence.\n\n"

    "ABSTRACT":"The J. C. Barnett Archives and Library at the Oldham County Historical Society's History Center campus became affiliated with the Kentucky Historical Society in 1963, and has since sought to preserve, collect and convey the unique history of Oldham County by telling the story of its people and the events that shaped its development, using objects and artifacts that illustrate and symbolize that history. The Archives also seeks to provide an environment in which the life of the past is experienced in the present, through its exhibits, programs, and activities that bring objects and artifacts to life.\n\nThree buildings make up the Oldham County Historical Society's History Center campus: J.C. Barnett Archives and Library, the Peyton Samuel Head Family Museum, and the Rob Morris Chapel and Educational Building. The J.C. Barnett Archives and Library is a restored 1840 €œKentucky Four Square€ house. Slave owners James Mount (1796-1864) and Amanda Railey Mount (1810-1888) originally owned the home. The Archives holds in trust the archival public records of Oldham County under Resolution 03-07-95-01, which date back to 1824 when the county was formed. Collections include original land deeds signed by Patrick Henry, Thomas Jefferson and Isaac Shelby. It also holds numerous family records, early 19th century letters, slave indentures, wanted posters, court documents, tax records, receipts, and letters, over a thousand of which pertain to the enslaved.\n\nThe J.

    "ABSTRACT":" The Henry Burden house, located in Dorchester, Nebraska, was the home of Henry Burden, a freedom seeker who escaped his enslavement in Virginia during the Civil War. Henry Burden was born enslaved in Petersburg, Virginia around 1847.  As a teenager during the war, he was forced to build fortifications for the Confederacy in the vicinity of Petersburg. After one year, Burden escaped to the safety of the Union Army.  Burden then enlisted with the Union Army in Wisconsin and served one year with the 17th United States Colored Troop. After the war, Burden moved to Pleasant Hill, Nebraska where he took advantage of the Homestead Act and started a farm on an 80 acre plot of land. Sometime between 1870 and 1872, Burden built a one room house where he and his wife raised a large family.  On October 11, 1913, Burden died leaving his home to his family.  Eventually, the children of Burden either died or moved away and the property was sold.  In the late 1960s, the Burden home was threatened with demolition as the owner had no use for the building.  In 1971, the home was donated and relocated to the Saline County Historical Society Museum.  Currently the home is used as part of the county museum and interprets the life of Henry Burden, including his escape from slavery.\n\n\n"

    "ABSTRACT":"The 274-acre Hampton Plantation State Historic Site, a former rice plantation located in Charleston County, South Carolina, is a site associated with several documented cases of attempted escapes. An estimated 340 enslaved people worked on the property at the height of rice production in the early 1800s. Freedom seekers included a series of men who may have escaped by water, since the extensive swamps of the Santee Delta offered a temporary refuge. Some ran away to reunite with relatives or friends at other plantations. Though it is not known how many escapes were successful, Hampton stands as a representative example of an escape site in the South Carolina rice region."

    "ABSTRACT":"Aspen Grove Cemetery is an integrated cemetery in Burlington, Iowa, established in 1843. The cemetery is the final resting place of one freedom seeker and three individuals who provided assistance to freedom seekers. Freedom seeker, Rachel Bundy (d. 1879) ran away from her owner, who had brought her to Burlington and won her freedom in a legal battle. Catherine \"Aunt Kitty\" Sandridge (c.1803 - d. 1863), a formerly enslaved women who had purchased her freedom, provided refuge to freedom seekers passing through the area. Reverend William Salter (1821-1910), known as the \"Abolitionist Preacher\" provided assistance to freedom seekers including \"contraband\" during the Civil War. David Rorer (1806 - 1884), a lawyer, provided legal representation for freedom seekers. Burlington, partly because of its location along the Mississippi River, and partly as a result of those who chose to settle there, became an important place along the Underground Railroad. The four individuals named above, spent the remainder of their lives in Burlington and had important roles in society. They would all eventually be laid to rest in the still-active Aspen Grove Cemetery."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Reverend Samuel Green was an Underground Railroad agent active in Dorchester County, Maryland, during the 1850s and possibly earlier. A literate farmer and Methodist preacher, Green had purchased his own freedom in 1833. Harriet Tubman testified that she occasionally stayed with Green during her rescue missions. In the spring of 1857, after aiding in the daring and dramatic escape of eight self-liberators, collectively known as the Dover Eight, Green was arrested and brought to trial. Acquitted by an all-white jury, frustrated local slaveholders and law enforcement charged him a second time. His crime? Possessing a copy of Harriet Beecher Stowe's anti-slavery novel, Uncle Tom's Cabin. Prosecutors argued that Green violated Maryland's law governing possession of abolitionist literature by free or enslaved people of color. In May, he was convicted and sentenced to ten years in the state prison. Rev. Green was one of the original preachers and a church trustee, who, in August 1844 established the Colored People's Methodist Episcopal Church in East New Market. The descendant congregation now worships as Faith Community United Methodist Church. Faith Community is the second structure to house this continuously active congregation. The original church site, on land deeded to the trustees by a freed woman, Sarah Young and her three children, Clem, George, and Rosette Young Dodson, has recently been reacquired by the congregation. The original church site is being nominated for its relationship to Underground Railroad agent Samuel Green, and the current church site through its descendant congregation for its links to Green, the original church, and probable ancestral relationships with freedom seekers who fled from the immediate vicinity."

    "ABSTRACT":"The subject of this nomination is the Harriet Beecher Stowe House, the primary building on a property that also includes a barn and a college dormitory. Harriet Beecher Stowe lived in the house from 1850 to 1852. In addition to writing \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" in the house, Stowe sheltered freedom seeker John Andrew Jackson for one night in November 1850. This event helped inspire Stowe to write her novel and allowed Jackson to go on to write an autobiography and become a prominent lecturer in England. The house has undergone multiple renovations since 1852, but the layout of rooms is largely intact, including the room where Stowe sheltered Jackson. Today, the property is owned by Bowdoin College, and the house serves primarily as faculty offices.  The College hopes that visitors will be able to reflect on the legacies of Stowe - and Jackson - sparking change via the written word. One room will emphasize both these legacies and the history of Stowe's time in the house. It will be opened to the public as an exhibition space.\n\n\n"

    "ABSTRACT":" Located in Detroit, Michigan, Historic Elmwood Cemetery, founded in 1846, is the Midwest's oldest integrated cemetery. Over one dozen Underground Railroad participants and several abolitionists are buried in Elmwood. From city founders and industrialists to those born in bondage and poverty, Elmwood offered a final resting place and continues its mission today.  Freedom seekers lay steps from Underground Railroad workers and abolitionists. Eternally in Elmwood are Detroit Underground Railroad participants:  African Americans William Lambert, George DeBaptiste, Dr. Joseph Ferguson, William Webb and Lisette Denison Forth; and European Americans Sen. Zachariah Chandler, Samuel Zug, Horace Hallock, Sen. Jacob M. Howard, Judge Ross Wilkins, James Joy, Rev. Oren Cook Thompson and shipbuilding magnate Eber Brock Ward.  Lambert and DeBaptiste headed an organized transnational network to protect freedom seekers in Michigan or ferry them across the Detroit River to the Canadian Provinces. Lisette Denison Forth's burial in Stranger's Ground belies her life: born enslaved; denied freedom in a landmark Michigan Territorial Court case; escape to Canada; and return to a prosperous life in Michigan. Abolitionists in Elmwood include Elijah Brush, Shubael Conant, and James Robinson. While the homes of many participants are gone, their burial sites memorialize their contributions to end slavery in North America and highlight Detroit's role as the most important gateway to freedom in Canada.\n\n"

    "ABSTRACT":"Built in 1830, this five-bay brick, center hall late Federal Style house located in Putnam, Ohio (now Zanesville) was home to Major Horace Nye (1786-1859) and his second wife Lucinda Belknap Nye (1792-1874). Both were active abolitionists who participated in the Underground Railroad. Major Nye participated in Ohio Anti-Slavery Society state conventions held in Putnam's Stone Academy in 1835 and 1839, presiding at the later event. His wife was president of the Muskingum County Female Anti-Slavery Society. They were members of the Putnam Presbyterian Church, which had strong ties to the Underground Railroad, and is recognized as a site in the Network to Freedom.  Nye's surviving children, one of which was also active, later shared their father's involvement in the Underground Railroad.\n\nThe home sits squarely on the street as was typical of more densely populated towns in the east. Particularly noteworthy is the raised doorway with fan light. The house is listed on the National Register as part of Zanesville's Putnam Historic District for \" the significant role that Putnam residents and institutions played in the Ohio debate about the abolition of slavery and the activity of sheltering fugitive slaves in the years prior to the Civil War. The house is currently a private residence."

    "ABSTRACT":" \"The Underground Railroad/Abolition Boats Provide an Escape to Freedom in Erie County\" historic marker is located at the foot of Franklin Street in Sandusky's Shoreline Park. The marker rests several yards from Sandusky Bay, which leads into the channel accessing for Lake Erie, would have been historically where boats docked.  The south facing side of the marker broadly defines the Underground Railroad. The north facing side, commemorates the \"abolition boats\" which provided transportation to freedom seekers. Wilbur Siebert's map of Underground Railroad routes graphically illustrates the dense network of routes crisscrossing Ohio northward toward Lake Erie's extensive southern shoreline. Sandusky's lengthy shoreline proved especially appealing. The marker identifies a number of vessels which readily carried freedom across the lake, and the captains who fearlessly piloted safely vessels safely across to Canada. Opportunities to earn passage if necessary, along with the support of a number of sympathetic  individuals who lived in Sandusky or worked on the lake, further enticed freedom seekers to this prominent destination on the Underground Railroad. The marker was dedicated in 2004by the Freedoms of Freedom Society, Inc. (FOFS) in collaboration with the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) on a \"site donated by the City of Sandusky. The marker is the northern most destination of the Ohio's \"River€œto- Lake Freedom Trail.\""

    "ABSTRACT":"The Bedford City Cemetery in Bedford, Iowa established in 1870, is the burial site of John \"Jack\" Howe (c. 1832-1915), a freedom seeker and Union soldier during the Civil War. John Howe was born into slavery in Virginia (West Virginia). Howe was later enslaved in Missouri at the Davis Farm, until he sought his freedom in 1862. Howe was able to make his escape during the chaos that ensued during this time period. Sometime in 1862, Confederate troops arrived on the Davis farm and told his enslaved property that they were to leave the farm and accompany them. Fearing for the lives of his wife and children, Howe escaped the farm and fled into Iowa. After becoming free, Howe volunteered to join the Union army in 1864. He was sent to 55th USCT, Company K. Howe began his time in the infantry as a private and kept his rank until he was eventually discharged. After serving during the war, Howe returned to Taylor County, Iowa and soon after moved to a farm in Holt Township, where he resided until his wife's death. He later remarried and divorced a woman by the name of Elizabeth Carter. He eventually moved to Bedford, where he resided until his death on December 15, 1915."

    "ABSTRACT":"Evergreen Cemetery in Red Oak, Iowa was established in 1854 and is the final resting place of William Wallace Merritt (1832-1922), an Underground Railroad operative who was active around the towns of Frankfort and Red Oak, Iowa, during the years 1857-1865. Merritt discussed his anti-slavery views as well as his participation in Underground Railroad activities in his book, A History of Montgomery County from the Earliest Days to 1906, and also in letters that he wrote to his mother and Wilbur H. Siebert. Merritt stated he would never turn away any freedom seeker who sought out his help. He recalled being involved in two incidents, one in which Rev. John Todd of Tabor, whose home and burial are recognized by the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom, brought eight freedom seekers to Merritt's house, leaving Merritt to deliver the freedom seekers to the next station in Cass County and another involving seven freedom seekers. The latter incident involved a freedom seeker who had escaped from Kentucky and fled to Canada but had returned to retrieve his six family members and escort them to freedom. An unknown Congregation clergyman brought the group of freedom seekers to Merritt's residence to rest before escorting them to the next station. During and after the Civil War, Merritt served in a variety of public offices including state representative (1870-1872) and mayor of Red Oak. He passed away on January 11, 1922."

    "ABSTRACT":"Newsome Park is a city park in Elgin, Illinois that commemorates a community of freedom seekers that dates back to October 15,  1862, when a group of  over 100 \"contrabands\" from Franklin County, Alabama arrived by train in Elgin. The park was designed as a gateway park for a widened Kimball Street in 1992, and was named for Arthur Newsome (1826-1913)and Peter Newsome (1826-1907), unrelated freedom seekers who settled in Elgin, and became leaders of the African American community known as \"the Settlement\". The two men were also founding trustees, in the Second Baptist Church, which was the cornerstone of the community and stood on the property that is now the park site from 1866-1961. In 2015, interpretive signage was installed in the park that gives visitors information about the history of the community, including the events of the Civil War that led to their arrival, the Second Baptist Church, the Fremont Community Center, and individual biographies of notable residents.\n"

    "ABSTRACT":"\"Project 2-3-1\"\" Two Boxcars, Three Blocks, One City: A Story of Elgin's African American Heritage \"(\"Project 2-3-1\") is a 75-minute documentary film and traveling exhibit that premiered in 2015, created in partnership with the Elgin History Museum, Grindstone Video Productions, and long-time community resident Ernie Broadnax. It traces the development of the African American community in Elgin, Illinois, which origins date back to October 15, 1862 when approximately 110 freedom seekers, predominately women and children from northern Alabama, traveled by train to the city in two box cars. The freedom seekers who had escaped during the chaos of the Civil War, first found refuge behind Union Lines at Corinth, Mississippi before being transported by train by former Elgin resident Rev. Benjamin F. Thomas, a chaplain in the 52nd Infantry Illinois. \"Project 2-3-1\" examines \"how these ex-slaves created a new life in a city that was both a mix of abolition sentiment and racial intolerance. The story continues through the civil rights era of the 1960s and into today focusing on the challenges and accomplishments of the community.\" Among the goals of \"Project 2-3-1\" was to broaden understanding of Elgin's relationship to the Civil War, Underground Railroad, and abolition.\n"

    "ABSTRACT":"In 1833, the Wayne County Jail was the site of the Blackburn Rescue and Riots, which are considered the first racial riots or the \"First Negro Insurrection\" in Detroit. Thornton and Lucie (originally Ruthie) Blackburn, husband and wife, were freedom seekers who had escaped from Louisville, Kentucky and after living in Detroit two years were arrested, tried, and convicted as fugitive slaves under the 1793 Fugitive Slave Act. During these events, the Wayne County Jail where the couple was being held, became a site of interracial protest on behalf of the couple. Awaiting their return to Kentucky, the Blackburn couple first Lucie and then Thornton, were rescued, liberated and assisted across the Detroit River into Canada in a carefully planned escape by African American community leaders who would three years later in 1836, found the legendary Underground Railroad station in Detroit, Second Baptist Church. Despite the fact that the Blackburns successfully made it to freedom, the protest continued. In connection with the rescue and riots, members of the African American community were arrested and held in the jail. Meanwhile, British officials refused two extradition attempts, creating Canada's first refugee reception policy in order to protect the Blackburns. This landmark case created Canada as the legal terminus for the Underground Railroad; today's modern Canadian extradition law still rests on its principles. The former jail site is now occupied by the Rose and Robert Skillman Branch of the Detroit Public Library."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Corinth Contraband Camp is a unit of Shiloh National Military Park located in Corinth, MS. After Corinth's occupation by Union forces, the small town became a focal point for enslaved people attempting to free themselves from bondage on farms and plantations, primarily the Black Prairie region of North Alabama. These refugees were referred to as \"contraband of war.\" Superior in design and administration to other camps, this \"model\" camp was active from November 1862 to January 1864. At any given time, an estimated 1,500 to 6,000 people were part of this vibrant community, which consisted of homes, trade shops, a hospital, church, and school house. Hundreds of acres were put under the plow and everyone earned a wage. The men from the camp enlisted to swell the ranks of the Union army and many saw combat.\n\nA 21-acre portion of the original Contraband Camp is developed as a commemorative park. Positioned along a paved walkway are several life-sized bronze statues of newly freed men and women engaged in the daily activites of the camp. This site, opened in May 2009,  commemorates the African-Americans who came to Corinth seeking a start of a new life and took their unswerving steps on the long road to full citizenship.\n"

    "ABSTRACT":"We are nominating the former site of Kelsey's Landing, a nonextant commercial dock and grain elevator that was located just north of the Lower Falls on the west side of the Genesee River in Rochester, NY. Our marker would be installed along the path where Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman and prominent Rochesterians led slaves onto cargo steam ships bound for Canada and Detroit from 1847 to 1859 (Calarco, Tom; Cynthia Vogel. Places of the Underground Railroad. Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, 2011, p.287). Upon Douglass' return to Rochester from a speaking tour in 1859, \"Amy and Isaac Post took him [Douglass] after dark to the wharf below the lower falls [emphasis ours] and put him on a boat for Canada\" (O'Keefe, p.68). This is Kelsey's Landing at the Lower Falls in Rochester, NY. Twenty-one years after his escape in 1838, and thirteen years after manumission in 1846 from the Auld and Richardson families, Douglass, orator, publisher, and Underground Railroad Stationmaster in Rochester, New York, was himself conducted to a cargo steamer at Kelsey's Landing, bound for Canada, England and freedom in 1859."

    "ABSTRACT":"The National Underground Railroad Freedom Center (NURFC) is a Museum of Conscience located in Cincinnati, Ohio, that opened in 2004. Founded in 1994 and partially funded by Congress through Public Law 106-291 in 2000, its mission is to \"reveal stories about freedom's heroes, from the era of the Underground Railroad to contemporary times, challenging and inspiring everyone to take courageous steps for freedom today\". In 2014, the Freedom Center was accredited by the American Alliance of Museums.  Focusing on engagement and education, the Freedom Center uses exhibits, programs, library/archival collections, and curated curriculum to tell the story of the Underground Railroad and make connections with ongoing struggles for freedom and human rights.  The exhibits, including an authentic slave pen, bring to life the horrors of slavery, the bravery of those who fought it, and the courage of those who chose to escape through the Underground Railroad.  The exhibits also stress the depth and breadth of this network as well as its place in the overall abolition efforts of the time, tying together the historical movements."

    "ABSTRACT":"Located five miles north of Ripley in Brown County, Ohio, is the Red Oak Presbyterian Church and an adjacent cemetery encircled by an old rock wall. Many members of the Red Oak Presbyterian Church, some whose remains are buried in the old cemetery, participated in Underground Railroad work. The congregation, formed in 1798, is one of the oldest Presbyterian churches in the state. It is listed on the National Register not only for its architecture, but also for the antislavery activities of its congregation, most notably Rev. James Gilliland, who arrived in 1805 and led the church for 39 years. However, the church's antislavery activities predate Gilliland's arrival as many of the earliest families arrived in the 1790s. Many came to Red Oak in order to liberate those they had enslaved and work for the abolition of slavery. Many whose roots extended back to the church played pivotal roles in Underground Railroad activities not only in Ohio, but across the nation as it expanded west. Despite the congregation's tremendous influence in the struggle against slavery and the Underground Railroad, their role has largely been unrecognized. The current church building erected in 1817, is also believed to have sheltered freedom seekers. Today, the church continues as a worshipping congregation, among its members are a few descendants of Underground Railroad activists.\n"

    "ABSTRACT":"Hope Cemetery in Wessington Springs, South Dakota was the final resting place of Reverend John Newton Cross (1797- 1885), an abolitionist pastor who was active in the Underground Railroad. Cross was an outspoken and openly defiant of the Fugitive Slave Law. Even making his participation known, publishing in the abolitionist newspaper, The Western Citizen. John Cross was also affiliated with educational institutions that have strong ties with abolitionism including Wheaton College in Illinois and Amity College in Iowa. He used his travels preaching and lecturing for the antislavery cause to set up Underground Railroad networks in Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, and Iowa. In Knox County, Illinois, he actively transported freedom seeker between stations on the Underground Railroad. In 1843, Cross was arrested for transporting freedom seekers. He was brought before a court in Knox County, the case was later dismissed. He later moved to Iowa where he helped set up Amity College and continued to participate in Underground Railroad activities."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Local History Department of the Boone County Public Library (BCPL) System specializes in the compiling of Boone County's past through genealogical and historical records and is the most comprehensive source of Boone County, Kentucky information. Established in 2005 and housed at the Main Library in Burlington, Kentucky, the department's mission is to collect, preserve, and digitize primary materials; make those materials available for research purposes; and to create content related to Boone County history and genealogy in the form of programs, books, articles, and web pages. Resources available to researchers include: microfilmed Boone County Church records, court records, deeds, guardianship bonds, marriage records, school census, tax records and will books. The department offers genealogical and historical research services, a wide-range of programing for all age groups, a collection of digital, microfilm and print materials, and public access to databases.\nNearly 25% of Boone County's population was enslaved in 1860. As a result, a vast amount of information documenting the African American experience is interwoven into Boone County records. In addition, well-known, documented UGRR routes passed through Boone County into Ohio and Dearborn Counties, Indiana, as well as, Hamilton County, Ohio. BCPL's Local History Department embarked on a comprehensive project in 2013 to compile and disseminate the UGRR history in Boone County, Kentucky."

    "ABSTRACT":"\"The Underground Railroad in Boone County Kentucky Bus Tour\", developed in 2013, is a 60 mile guided bus tour, which takes visitors on a detailed and intense journey through Boone County, Kentucky, which is located on the Ohio River, about 15 minutes from downtown Cincinnati, Ohio and bordering both Ohio and Indiana. The five stop tour is based on local, regional, and national stories, sites, buildings, and landscapes, associated with numerous well-known and somewhat obscure aspects of the Underground Railroad in Boone County, Kentucky.  This tour visits sites in Richwood, Big Bone, Rabbit Hash, Petersburg, and North Bend and guides visitors to the homes, churches and other significant areas associated with the Underground Railroad movement in Boone County. Visitors hear stories of the Underground Railroad through the activities of individuals such as Elijah Anderson, Samuel Barkshire, the \"Cincinnati 28,\" Margaret Garner, Laura Smith Haviland, and John Van Zandt. The various actions of these and many other individuals, in operating the Underground Railroad in Boone County, Kentucky, helped hundreds of freedom seekers escape the system of human bondage in the Bluegrass state to several river cities and towns in both southern Indiana and southwestern Ohio in their bid for freedom."

    "ABSTRACT":"Built in 1806, the African Meeting House served as the religious, educational, and political center of the black community in 19th century Boston. Located on the north slope of Beacon Hill, this church became the center for community action including the abolition movement, the struggle for equality, and the Underground Railroad. People who escaped from slavery worshipped and ministered at this church, and slave catchers were known to look for them there. Numerous meetings were held here to provide for fugitive assistance. For example, the New England Freedom Association used this space to plan strategies for assisting those escaping slavery. The community met here to protest the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 and to coordinate their collective responses to it. The African Meeting House is associated with prominent persons related to the Underground Railroad including Lewis Hayden, William Cooper Nell, and William Craft all of whom have well documented ties to fugitive slave assistance."

    "ABSTRACT":"Guilford College Woods, formerly New Garden Woods, is part of the Guilford College Campus in Greensboro, North Carolina. Located within the historically Quaker New Garden/Guilford College community, the 200-acre woods remain a relatively stable landscape with old growth forest and at least one champion tree standing as a silent witness. Abolitionist Levi Coffin grew up north of the site and references these woods between his home and his New Garden Quaker Meeting as a place of refuge. The case of John Dimery's escape and quick movement to Indiana in 1819 is the earliest documented instance of Underground Railroad activity. Levi and Vestal Coffin were known leaders assisting runaways going to Indiana from 1819 to 1826. After moving from North Carolina, Levi would become one of the leading figures in the nation's Underground Railroad movement. The legacy of justice continued with documented anti-slavery activists serving on the initial staff of New Garden Boarding School when it opened in 1837. An 1842 runaway notice in the local paper specifically references the New Garden community. For those enslaved in the region, the New Garden Woods were known as the Southern Terminus of the Underground Railroad. From there, freedom seekers would follow one of America's busiest UGRR routes, which, by the 1850s, might have taken them northwest toward Levi Coffin's large boarding house in Indiana before they continued to freedom in Canada."

    "ABSTRACT":"New Garden Friends Meeting in Greensboro, North Carolina, was the spiritual home of Levi and Vestal Coffin, two of the most active leaders in America's Underground Railroad movement. Vestal and his wife, Alethea, are buried in the New Garden Cemetery. The site is across New Garden Road from Guilford College and within walking distance (just under one mile) of the Guilford College Woods site, known as the Underground Railroad's southern terminus. The Quaker belief in \"that of God in everyone\" led to intense soul searching in the meetinghouse over the issue of slavery. The meetinghouse hosted statewide annual sessions from 1814 to 1865. North Carolina Friends made numerous legal challenges to the institution of slavery. Often led by New Garden Friends, they petitioned the state legislature, prohibited members from owning or profiting from slavery, and often purchased those who were enslaved when manumission was not permitted.

The Inn, which also served as the private residence of the family, was built by patriarch Peter Wickerham (1756-1841), between 1801 and 1805. Located on an important Underground Route, the Zane's Trace (later the Maysville-Chillicothe Turnpike), the Inn served as a stop on the Underground Railroad In addition to its Underground Railroad connection, the Inn is one of the oldest brick building located in the county (probably the oldest) and one of the earliest inn/taverns to exist in the Northwest Territory"

He was confined to the cellar to pound bricks into its mud floor, as punishment for \"talking back\" to Mrs. Minge because she excoriated him for a broken carriage. Turnage was thrown from the horse and just missed being run-over by a streetcar. Confederate soldiers retrieved the horse and took Turnage back to the Minge's home. After suffering a brutal beating of 30 lashes, Turnage headed southward, walking 25 miles down the western shore of Mobile Bay. On his trek to freedom, frightened and starving, Turnage transversed Confederate troop encampments, snake-filled swamps, mosquito infested marshlands, and alligator lined waterways. After surviving three weeks in the Fowl River estuary, he paddled a rowboat into the Bay. Turnage was saved from drowning by sailors in a Union Navy gunboat. He was taken to Fort Gaines and freed on August 24, 1864."

    "ABSTRACT":"The site of the Old Log Jail, a former jail completed in 1851 and located in Winterset, Iowa, was associated with an Underground Railroad rescue. During the Civil War, in late October of 1861, four freedom seekers Anderson Hays, Henderson Hays, John Ross Miller, and Alex Nichols escaped from Nodaway County, Missouri. They followed the North Star on their journey, hiding during the day and moving at night. In Iowa, the freedom seekers were found out by local citizens of Winterset, captured, and brought to the Old Log Jail. While some men went looking for a jail guard, a group of people sympathetic to the freedom seekers circled around the scene and set the freedom seekers free. Afterwards, the group of people gave the freedom seekers food and water and told them of other stops they could visit on the Underground Railroad.\nThe log jail fell into disrepair and the city decided to sell the property and it was later torn down in 1866. Currently, there is a commercial building built in 1912 located at the site."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Black Heritage Trail is a walking tour through the Beacon Hill neighborhood of downtown Boston. This trail is offered as a guided tour by Boston African American National Historic Site (BOAF) National Park Rangers. It can also be taken as a self-guided tour using the BOAF brochure. This tour explores the rich history of the black community in antebellum Boston with a focus on its leading role in the abolition movement, the struggle for civil rights, and the Underground Railroad. This tour begins at the Robert Gould Shaw Memorial and makes its way through the north slope of Beacon Hill stopping at sites that were the homes, schools, and meeting spaces of the 19th century black community in Boston. Sites along the trail include the home of Lewis and Harriet Hayden, a well-documented station on the Underground Railroad. Others sites include the homes of John J. Smith, John Coburn, and William Cooper Nell, all of whom were integral to Boston's Underground Railroad. One of the final stops along the tour is the African Meeting House, a center of the black community's religious, educational, and political life that also served as an important gathering space for Underground Railroad activity."

    "ABSTRACT":"Cape May's Underground Railroad (UGRR) trolley tour educates visitors about the area's little known involvement in the Underground Railroad. Located at the southern tip of New Jersey, across the Delaware Bay from the slave states of Maryland and Delaware, the Cape May vicinity offered freedom seekers a temporary refuge on their way further north. Visitors hear stories of the people fleeing slavery who came through Cape May on their way north. They hear about the help they received here and about people who tried to stop them. The 7-mile ride focuses on six specific sites, and visitors are able to get off the trolley and walk around at three stops. It begins at a beach with a view of the Cape May Lighthouse, a visual beacon of hope to enslaved people 17 miles away in Delaware and the destination of several groups of freedom seekers who landed nearby. The tour highlights two prominent Underground Railroad leaders, Philadelphia businessman Stephen Smith, who summered for 25 years in Cape May, and Harriet Tubman who worked as a cook in town. Visitors view Smith's home and discuss where Tubman may have worked. Visitors learn about the kidnapping of a free black man sold into slavery and view the antebellum home of his relatives. The tour emphasizes the role of free black communities in helping freedom seekers and visitors learn about two local families likely involved in this. They walk through an antebellum cemetery where rest some of these family members, alongside relatives of Tubman."

    "ABSTRACT":"The two-story white brick home, located on Ripley, Ohio's Front Street, on the Ohio River, was the residence of Dr. Alexander Campbell (1779-1857), a physician, politician, and merchant who was active in the Underground Railroad. Often referred to as the state's first abolitionist, Campbell, a man of uncompromising anti-slavery principles, came to Ohio from Kentucky, in 1803 or 1804, after freeing the enslaved people that he had inherited. He moved to Ripley in 1815, becoming the town's first physician. While it was remembered that a freedom seeker stopped at his home around 1826, he largely worked behind the scenes, assisting in planning and organization of Ripley's Underground Railroad activities."

    "ABSTRACT":"Established in 1826, Erie Street Cemetery, originally known as \"City Cemetery,\" is considered the oldest existing cemetery in Cleveland, Ohio, and is where many of the city's early settlers and pioneers are buried, including some who were involved in Underground Railroad activities. Those buried in the cemetery with a documented association with the Underground are: Reuben Harmon (R.H.) Blackmer (1793-1862): A grocer, originally from Vermont who was a member of the Fugitive/Freedmen's Aid Society. Major Lorenzo Carter (1766/67-1814): Considered Cleveland's first permanent white settler, he assisted a freedom seeker simply remembered as \"Ben.\" John Malvin (1795-1880):A free-born African American, who was active in the Underground Railroad in Cincinnati and Cleveland. Madison Tilley (1824-1887): A freedom seeker from Tennessee who became further involved in the Underground Railroad in Cleveland as a member of the Fugitive/Freedmen Aid Society. At one time, here were more Underground Railroad operatives buried in the cemetery, but their bodies were removed and reinterred at other area cemeteries. Those include Thomas Thomas Bolton (1809-1871), an attorney who was involved in an 1841 fugitive slave case and David Hazzard Crosby (1824-1890), an African American who was on the executive committee of the Fugitive Aid/Freedmen's Aid Society. The 8-acre cemetery currently contains approximately 14,000 burials of its original 18,000 burials. It is owned and maintained by the city."

    "ABSTRACT":"Located in Mentor, Ohio, the James A. Garfield National Historic Site is a unit of the National Park System that commemorates and interprets the life of James Abram Garfield (1831-81), 20th President of the United States. The site includes the home the Garfields purchased in 1876 and that was the site of Garfield's 1880 \"front porch\" presidential campaign. Garfield was anti-slavery in the years leading up to the Civil War and evidence shows that at least twice in his early life, James Garfield provided assistance to freedom seekers. Once the war began he joined the Union army to help save the nation and abolish slavery. Garfield made it very clear that slavery was, in his view, the primary cause of the war. As a Union officer, he expressed great frustration at being unable to help enslaved African Americans escape the \"peculiar institution.\" During his Civil War service, he advocated for and participated in the Union army freeing those enslaved in the South and providing refuge for African Americans trying to escape from plantations and the Confederacy. During his long career in the House of Representatives (1863-1881), Garfield was a steady and constant supporter of the civil and political rights of the formerly enslaved. Upon becoming President in 1881, Garfield, one of the few prominent Republicans still vocally advocating for civil rights, called \"the elevation of the Negro race from slavery to the full rights of citizenship the most important political change we have known since the adoption of the Constitution of 1787.\" His work for the abolition of slavery and African American civil rights, including participating in the Underground Railroad makes James A. Garfield National Historic Site€the only national site dedicated to the interpretation of President Garfield's life and career€a highly appropriate site to include on the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Rankin-McNishe House in Ripley, Ohio is a three-family dwelling originally built in the fall of 1823 by Rev. John Rankin, a well-known Underground Railroad conductor. John Rankin assumed pastoral duties at First Presbyterian Church in 1822. While living here, John Rankin expressed his anti-slavery feelings by writing his \"Letters on Slavery\", which were published in the Castigator, a local anti-slavery newspaper that operated out of one of the home's apartments. In 1828, fearing those who opposed his anti-slavery lectures, Rankin bought land and built a house, overlooking the river valley. While it is this later residence located on what came to be known as \"Liberty Hill\" that is most associated with Rankin's Underground Railroad activities, he was also associated with activities at his earlier Front Street home, even after he no longer resided there. Indications of this come from an incident that occurred when William and Lucinda McNishe, Rankin's brother in-law and sister in-law, who purchased the home from Rankin in 1828 were living there. In the 1830s a teenage enslaved girl who had escaped from Maysville, Kentucky came to their door because she knew the house with three front doors was a gateway to freedom. With John Rankin's help, the McNishes were able to get the girl away from Ripley and safely on her journey north to freedom."

    "ABSTRACT":"The 25-acre estate, Spiegel Grove in Fremont, Ohio, is a monument to the 19th President of the United States Rutherford B. Hayes (1822-1893) and his wife Lucy Ware Webb Hayes (1831-1889). The house began as a summer home in 1863 (when construction completed), becoming a primary residence from 1873 until the President's death in 1893. Early in his career, probably as a result of his wife's anti-slavery influence, Hayes defended fugitive slaves as a lawyer in Cincinnati, helping to uphold the freedom of Rosetta Armstead and other enslaved people who had escaped from the South. As a general in the northern army during the Civil War he fought specifically for the purpose of ending slavery stating, \"freedom, freedom for all. We all know that is the essence of this contest.\" Having helped to secure the freedom of a few through the legal process and then helping to end slavery as a soldier, he then hoped to secure political rights for freed men as a politician. Working to ensure the passage of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments and fighting attempts by Southern leaders to remove federal protection of voting polls in the federal elections. The home, now part of the Rutherford B. Hayes Presidential Library , Museums, became a state-owned property in 1965 and has been open for tours since."

    "ABSTRACT":"In 1862, Robert Smalls, along with family and friends, escaped enslavement in Charleston, South Carolina, on a stolen Confederate ship. Smalls was born enslaved on April 5, 1839, in Beaufort, South Carolina. When Smalls was 12, his owner, Henry McKee, sent the boy to Charleston to be hired out. Smalls' love of the sea led him to work on the docks and wharves of Charleston, which quickly made him deeply knowledgeable of Charleston Harbor.  In the fall of 1861, Smalls was assigned to steer the CSS Planter (a lightly armed Confederate military transport). On May 12, 1862, the Planter's three white officers decided to spend the night ashore. At about 3 a.m. the following morning, Smalls and seven of the eight enslaved crewmen made a run for the Union ships blockading the harbor. Smalls, dressed in the captain's uniform and a straw hat, not only sailed the Planter out of the southern wharf, but also stopped to free his and the crewman's families. Smalls became a hero and his accomplishments were celebrated in the North and among African Americans nationwide. He went on to dedicate his life to achieving equality for all. He held a variety of public offices, including severing five terms in the U.S. House of Representatives.\nSmalls died February 23, 1915, and is buried in the Tabernacle Baptist Church cemetery in Beaufort. Tabernacle Baptist Church is an active congregation."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Evergreen Cemetery in Colorado Springs, Colorado, is the final resting place of Edward Thompson Sheldon (1838-1911), an Underground Railroad operative who assisted freedom seekers in Southwest Iowa. In February 1860, Sheldon was involved in an Underground Railroad incident in which brothers William and John Thompson, John Martin, and one unidentified man believed to have been formerly enslaved from Indian Territory arrived in Tabor, Iowa. It is not clear if the men were free or had escaped, but regardless of their status they were treated as if they were freedom seekers traveling along the Underground Railroad. The men were forwarded to Edward Sheldon and Newton Woodford, who planned to transport the men to Lewis, Iowa in a covered wagon. However, their journey was temporarily cut short when they were spotted by a band of pro-slavery men in Mud Creek who had obtained a warrant from Justice of the Peace John Cramer for the arrest of Sheldon and Woodford for aiding the four men escape from slavery. Sheldon and Woodford were jailed in Glenwood, Iowa and brought to trial, where they were acquitted of all charges. Meanwhile proslavery men began to transport the four men to Missouri. Sheldon did not let his brush with the law deter him and shortly after being released, he, along with several abolitionists from Tabor, Iowa, went on to rescue the four men. Sheldon later served as a Captain in the Union Army, settled in Colorado where he later died on December 29, 1911."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Crete Cemetery and the First Congregational Church were created in the 1850s by a community with extensive commitments starting in the late 1830s to the anti-slavery movement and to providing assistance for freedom seekers traveling through northeastern Illinois. In 1841, a predecessor congregation in Crete Township passed one of the earliest anti-slavery resolutions issued in Illinois, and in 1843, members hosted a visit by Caroline Quarlls on her epic journey to freedom from St. Louis to Canada. Local history and family records provide documentation that beginning in the 1830s, the Batchelder, Beebe/Beach, Brown, Cook, and Cushing families provided direct assistance for a large number of freedom seekers. In 1843, Samuel Cushing was taken to court, accused of assisting fugitives. These families provided leadership and support for the congregation and the cemetery association. In addition, the Cole and Safford families who were active in assisting freedom seekers are buried in the cemetery although they helped start the Methodist Church. The cemetery was established in 1848 and the church building erected in 1853. The cemetery is owned by a community corporation. The church building is immediately east of it and has been privately owned and used for antique shops since 1963."

    "ABSTRACT":"Joel (1825-1879) and Emily Grover (1839-1921) sheltered freedom seekers in their 1858 stone barn on their farm near Lawrence, Douglas County, Kansas Territory during the late 1850s. The Grover Barn is documented to have been involved on at least two incidents with the Underground Railroad. One incident involved two freedom seekers that were transported to the barn and the other involved eleven \"slaves\" and a free-born baby who were hidden at the Grover barn in January 1859. The abolitionist, John Brown and his men had helped to liberate the group from slavery in Missouri the previous December in a highly publicized raid. After a brief stay at Grover barn on his last trip to Kansas, Brown led the freedom seekers to Detroit, Michigan, and saw them cross over into Canada. The Grover barn and a portion of the original farm remained in the Grover family for 105 years. From 1963- 1976 the barn was used as an artist's studio and in 1980 the City of Lawrence acquired the building for use as a Fire Station through 2006. This structure is one of the best preserved Underground Railroad stations still standing in Lawrence and is nationally significant not only because of its connection to John Brown, but also because of the rich documentation that exists about the twelve freedom seekers and their route to Canada."

    "ABSTRACT":"Built in 1742, Faneuil Hall has a long and cherished history in Boston. Though most known for its role as a focal point for colonial protests against Parliament in the years leading up to the American Revolution, Faneuil Hall later served as an important gathering space for public dissent and organized resistance to the fugitive slave laws of the country, making it an integral site in the Underground Railroad network. Beginning in the late 1830s, Boston's abolitionists began regularly using Faneuil Hall to host their meetings and rallies. Oftentimes, they called these meetings in response to high profile fugitive slave cases in the city. The abolitionists not only protested the arrest of fugitive slaves but also actively organized against the fugitive slave laws here. They pressured state and local officials to resist enforcing these federal laws and formed vigilance committees to assist those seeking freedom on the Underground Railroad, encouraging supporters to help those in need and thwart the slave catchers. Faneuil Hall provided an important venue where black and white abolitionists gathered to plan their collective action in support of those seeking their freedom on the Underground Railroad."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Reddy Gray Burial Site is the final resting place for a former slave who like so many others used the Underground Railroad to transition from a life of servitude to a free life. What is unique about Reddy Gray is we have good records on both halves of his life. He was born into servitude in Baltimore County, Maryland in 1842, the property of Thomas Cradock Risteau. After spending his early years as a field hand and carriage driver, he escaped in 1863. A runaway ad in the Baltimore Sun on February 3, 1863, documented his escape and called for his capture. Gray either eluded capture or it was short-lived as one year later he enlisted with the United States Colored Troops (USCT) in Baltimore. Surviving the war, his life as a free man in and around Baltimore is documented in pension, city directory and census records. He worked, married and raised a family. He was buried in Loudon Park National Cemetery upon his death in 1922. His post-escape life defied the stereotype of the helpless freedman. It also shows that someone formerly enslaved has a rich history which can be reclaimed through careful research."

    "ABSTRACT":"Second Baptist Church of Detroit, Michigan, is the oldest African American congregation in Detroit and was on the forefront of the Underground Railroad. Established in 1836, as the Society of Second Baptist, by thirteen African Americans, largely in protest to the racism and segregation that they experienced at First Baptist Church. Not only did Second Baptist play an important role in Underground Railroad activities, but Underground Railroad activities played an important role in Second Baptist. It was the 1833 \"Blackburn Affair,\" an Underground Railroad event, that is partly credited for prompting the organization of the church. After the church's founding, the church continued to play an active role in Underground Railroad activities. Several of the church's pastors and members of congregation, are documented to have been participants in the. Included among them are some of Detroit's most well-known activists: Robert Banks, George De Baptiste, William Lambert, Rev. William C. Monroe, and Madison J. Lightfoot. These men were also part of the Colored Vigilant Committee of the City of Detroit (CVC). Comprised entirely of African Americans, the CVC was the leading Underground Railroad organization in the city and Second Baptist served as an important meeting place for the CVC. Since its founding, the congregation has been located in various locations, but has been at its current location since 1857. Its congregation remains active and has a long history connected to African Americans' struggle for civil rights."

    "ABSTRACT":"The McCague House located on Front Street in Ripley, Ohio, right along the Ohio River, across from Kentucky was a station of the Underground Railroad. Thomas McCague (1793-1864) was a wealthy owner of a pork packing plant and flourmill in Ripley, and was also involved in banking. Thomas and his wife, Catharine Platter (1792-1879), also known as \"Kitty\" or \"Aunt Kitty\", were Underground Railroad operatives who assisted freedom seekers on their journeys out of bondage. The McCagues, part of an extensive a network of area families who offered assistance freedom seekers, worked with several operatives in Ripley to hide and transport freedom seekers north. Many operatives documented their collaboration with the McCagues including John Parker and members of John Rankin's family. The McCagues are most noted for being involved in an escape involving Eliza Harris, the inspiration for a character in Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher-Stowe, when she returned to help members of her family who remained enslaved."

Harriet's slave narrative is the most important narrative written by an African American woman and published by herself. The Grinnell Mansion was built in 1831, in a city well known for its part in the abolitionist movement, the Mansion was the home of Joseph Grinnell, one of the city's wealthiest and most influential citizens, and his daughter, Cornelia. In 1842, Harriet escaped from North Carolina and, with the assistance of the Underground Railroad's network to freedom, eventually arrived in New York City. There, she was hired as a nursemaid by Nathaniel Parker Willis and his wife, Cornelia Grinnell Willis. In 1851 and 1852, upon learning of Harriet's owner's arrival in New York and fearing Harriet would be captured and re-enslaved, Mrs. Willis arranged for Harriet to get to New Bedford on two documented occasions for sheltering in the Mansion, until she could buy Harriet's freedom."

    "ABSTRACT":"During the early 1800s, as many as 750 people made up the Angola Maroon Community that sprung up around a freshwater spring along the Manatee River in what is now Manatee Mineral Spring Park in Bradenton, Florida. Archaeological investigations identified evidence of Angola around the spring. An interpretive sign details the history of the maroons and of Angola. Angola (a name given to the site by historians) was a haven for free and formerly enslaved Blacks. Some were self-emancipated, having escaped from enslavement, others were born free in Spanish Florida. In the 1810s, border skirmishes and slave raids in northern Florida caused men, women, and children to seek safety south of the Manatee River. Families spread out along the Manatee River, the Braden River, and south towards Sarasota. They lived in freedom for a precious five years. Angola was destroyed in 1821 when over 300 individuals were captured. Those who escaped made their way to Cape Florida, where they met up with British boats and traveled to the Bahamas."

    "ABSTRACT":"The British built the Negro Fort at Prospect Bluff, in Eastpoint, Florida, during the War of 1812, allying themselves with Indian and maroon communities located along the Apalachicola River. The river and its headwaters had been the destination for escaped slaves since 1716, and the fort became the new center of that activity. The fort was built with the help of Black Cuban soldiers and manned by Black British Colonial Marines who had received their freedom by joining the British to fight against the Americans. The British posted hand bills across the south inviting all slaves to come to the fort to find freedom. Thousands took up the offer. By the time the war ended, maroon plantations extended for fifty miles upriver from the fort. After the British left in 1815, the fort served as a portal to freedom for increasing numbers of escaped slaves. During the fort's two-year operation, slaves from as far away as Virginia and as near as Pensacola came here. Transported by the British or finding their way on their own, formerly enslaved persons departed from the Negro Fort to establish free communities that still exist in the Bahamas, Mexico, Trinidad, Nova Scotia, Sierra Leone, Cuba, Texas , and Florida. In 1818, after a devastating American attack killed or wounded most of the maroon community at the site, an American fort, Fort Gadsden, was built under the direction of then Gen. Andrew Jackson. The current site is 92.6 acres."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Illinois & Michigan [the I & M] Canal Headquarters building in Lockport, Illinois, is nominated for inclusion in the Network to Freedom listings as the key site for recognizing the importance of the Canal in the journeys of freedom seekers through northern Illinois. Activities at this site were central to the building and administration of the Canal. Constructed in 1837, this is the most significant pre-Civil War public building still standing in northern Illinois. For decades, freedom seekers escaping from the south and traveling north along the Mississippi River valley often came up the Illinois River valley and then headed for Chicago, often along the route of the Canal. There is documentary evidence of their travels, both during its construction from 1836 to 1848 and after its completion. There is also evidence of the Canal as a site of rescue for some being transported back to slavery. The use of the canal in UGRR activities was facilitated by activists who lived along the canal and canal leaders and workers who were supporters of the abolitionist cause. For instance, Peter Stewart, who served as superintendent of the Canal after it opened in 1848 was indicted in 1843 for assisting fugitives and talked of himself as €œpresident€ of the Underground Railroad in Illinois. John Hossack, of Ottawa, a town on the Canal, who became nationally known after being arrested in 1859 for violating the Fugitive Slave Law, had been involved in the building of the canal and had encounters with freedom seekers while traveling on the Canal. Ichabod Codding, the great anti-slavery orator and UGRR activist used Lockport as his home base, often traveled on the Canal and is buried nearby. The building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972; is in the Lockport Historic District [on the National Register in 1975]; and is in the Illinois and Michigan Canal National Heritage Area.  It is now the home of the Will County Historical Society which maintains the bui"

    "ABSTRACT":"Forever Free is a curriculum-based educational program that was developed by history teacher Barry Jurgensen in 2009 to provide place based and group/collaborative learning opportunities for secondary students to engage with the history of the Underground Railroad (UGRR) through the gathering of primary sources to document UGRR activity, with the goal of nominating sites to the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom (NTF) Program. In addition to learning about the Underground Railroad, the program teaches students historical research methods and real world applications. This program was first introduced into an Honors History class at Arlington Public Schools in Arlington, Nebraska and led to the successful nomination of 28 sites in Nebraska, Iowa, South Dakota, Colorado, and Ohio to the NTF. Currently, the program is located at Westside Community Schools in Omaha, Nebraska, where it builds upon the school district's literacy framework, as the basis for Critical Thinking and Problem Solving in Social Studies, an elective course at Westside High School. Following the success of the program, Jurgensen and his students have been invited to speak about the program at conferences, local historical societies, community forums, and churches several times each year. Jurgensen also strives to connect the history of slavery to modern day slavery and has helped students take action against ongoing social injustice."

    "ABSTRACT":"Led by members and ministers who had escaped from slavery, the Michigan Street Baptist Church, founded in 1836 and built from 1845-49, became a center of Underground Railroad activity and abolitionist activism before the Civil War. Documentary evidence of several escape stories (1835, 1847, 1850s, and 1860) provides clues. So does evidence of ministers, elders, trustees, and members who had escaped from slavery and were active in the Underground Railroad (including Rev. Rufus Perry, enslaved in Tennessee; Rev. J. Sella Martin, enslaved in North Carolina; and trustees Peyton Harris, John Dandridge, and Henry K. Thomas, all from Virginia). Freeborn church members (such as Rev. Duke W. Anderson and Rev. Samuel Davis) were also active in the UGRR. These stories receive support from statistical evidence. Based on known birthplaces, eighty-nine percent of people affiliated with the Michigan Street Baptist Church before 1870 had been born in a slave state, seven of them definitely enslaved and the rest most likely enslaved. This church has been continuously owned and occupied by African Americans and is now the oldest standing African American church in Buffalo."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Sutliff Museum, located inside the Warren-Trumbull County Public Library in Warren, Ohio, was established in 1971. The Museum has a diverse collection of materials, both published and unpublished, showing the importance of the Sutliff family and Warren, Ohio in the anti-slavery movements, including the Underground Railroad. The Museum's mission, directed by its founder, Phebe Temperance Sutliff, is to preserve, exhibit, and interpret its collection and educate the community on the significance of the Sutliff family's influence on the local and national levels, the Victorian era, and the anti-slavery movements. From a hobble removed from the ankle of a freedom seeker (circa 1860) to the 1830 charter of the Vernon township women's anti-slavery society, the Sutliff Museum collection attempts to provide researchers and visitors with both broad and detailed interpretations of Warren and Trumbull County's history of the anti-slavery and Underground Railroad movements in relation to the Sutliff Family and their activities. The family's document collection contains letters, documents, and newspapers from 1835-1865 that give accounts of local anti-slavery activities and points of view. The Sutliff Museum is in position to be the logical location for research materials and objects, and has a director and board that continue to support the continued preservation of the collection."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Harriet Tubman UGRR Visitor Center is a 10,000 sq. ft. facility that immerses the visitor in the world of Tubman and other freedom seekers through multi-media and tactile exhibits that are both emotional and evocative. Themes highlight Tubman's early years in MD in the context of slavery on the Eastern Shore, the UGRR as a resistance movement, and Tubman's rescue missions and networks. Her work as a scout, spy, nurse, and strategist during the Civil War are also emphasized as well as her work as a humanitarian and suffragist. Park rangers facilitate meaningful connections between visitors and Tubman's life and legacy through interpretive programs and orientations. Since opening in March 2017, the Visitor Center also serves as the headquarters for the National UGRR Network to Freedom (NTF) Program and features an interactive electronic program highlighting NTF listings in the Center lobby. The Center library also provides access to electronic databases related to slavery and abolitionism. The bookstore, operated by Eastern National, complements the interpretive experience by offering quality educational souvenirs and historical books. An orientation film entitled Harriet Tubman: Soldier of Freedom will be featured in the Center theater in 2019."

    "ABSTRACT":"At the south edge of the City of Chicago, 15 miles due south of downtown, is the historic Jan and Aagje Ton Farm Site. Local history sources and family traditions, document the participation of the Ton Family, Dutch Immigrants, in the Underground Railroad. In the late 1840s, Dutch immigrants came to areas south of Chicago. Among the key settlers was the family of Jan and Aagje Ton, who, in 1853, acquired property on the north side of the Little Calumet River. This area was an important transportation route. Near their farm, early settlers developed a ferry, then toll bridge, across the river. Starting in 1837, the heavy traffic between Chicago and Detroit was funneled across this ferry and bridge. For the next 20 + years, this also became the major road for the movement of freedom seekers. The Ton Farm's proximity to routes going in and out of Chicago, provided opportunities for participation in the Underground Railroad. The Tons, working with others in the area, assisted freedom seekers traveling by lake or overland from the Chicago area to Detroit and Canada. The original Ton farm was 40 acres, now subdivided into many parcels and the historic buildings on the site are gone. This application is tied to a set of three privately owned parcels on the riverfront, just under one acre, where the farm house and outbuildings were located."

    "ABSTRACT":"Henry Highland Garnet was born enslaved on December 23, 1815 to William Spencer, who lived on a plantation called Darby near Chesterville, Kent County, Maryland. Spencer died on March 8, 1822, leaving Garnet's family “ then using the surname Trusty “ at risk for being sold by Spencer's heirs. Garnet's father received permission to attend a funeral in a neighboring county, enabling the family's escape sometime between Spencer's death and May 1822. The Trustys and seven other enslaved men took two horses and a wagon from the Spencer estate and made their way to Wilmington, DE, where they were aided by Thomas Garrett, a Quaker businessman, abolitionist, and Underground Railroad agent. From Wilmington, the Trustys traveled to New Hope, PA and then New York City, where they settled and took the name Garnet. For more than 10 years slavecatchers pursued them, capturing Henry's mother, Henny and the seven other men. New York abolitionists purchased Henny's freedom in January of 1830. Henry would later become a famous abolitionist and preacher, and in February 1865, become the first black minister to preach to the U.S. House of Representatives. €œDarby€ the original farm site where the Trusty/Garnet family escaped is currently marked by a newly erected state historical marker, located at the intersection of Routes 290 and 291 on state highway property."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Dorchester County Historical Society, Inc. (DCHS) has holdings of more than 2500 books, manuscripts, early newspapers, original ledgers and other record books which relate to Dorchester, Eastern Shore and Maryland history and heritage. A number of these directly relate to African American history, with some dating to the first quarter of the 19th century. Helpful in mounting African American genealogy, tracing population and movement throughout the County and around the Eastern Shore, these volumes also aid in tracing the slave holders and enslaved people who once made up a significant part of Maryland's population. This facility, known as the Todd Research Center, is open to the public Tuesday through Friday from 10 am to 4 pm and on Saturday from 10 am to 2 pm. All volumes are available for public use on site and a listing of the Center's holdings is available online at DCHS' website. Staff is available to assist with research as requested."

    "ABSTRACT":"Rocking the Cradle is a public program about Boston's response to the case of Anthony Burns who was arrested under the Fugitive Slave Law in 1854. Facilitated by National Parks of Boston staff and presented in Faneuil Hall, a recently designated Network to Freedom site, this program recreates the public meeting held in the aftermath of Burn's arrest. Participants receive a character card representing a historical figure and his/her position on the matters at hand. Cards include lines to be read aloud, as well as context that enable each visitor to forge a connection with their character. Audience members assume their parts, share their €œin character€ positions, and experience €œfirst hand€ the passion and fury of this meeting. Participants argue to either break the Fugitive Slave Law in an obedience to a €œHigher Law€, or comply with the Fugitive Slave Law to uphold €œConstitutional Law€ and ultimately vote on resolutions on how to proceed. Through these dramatic experiences rooted in primary source research and activated in the authentic space in which the event took place, visitors discover factors that galvanized large numbers of northerners to take a stand on slavery and emboldened people to challenge the Fugitive Slave Law."

    "ABSTRACT":"Mt. Evergreen Cemetery was established in 1843 and is owned and maintained by the City of Jackson, MI. It is the final resting place of seven men and one woman who participated in the Underground Railroad. The Jackson agents were husband and wife team William DeLand (1795- 1876) and Mary DeLand (1802-1878), who harbored freedom seekers in their home; their son Charles DeLand (1828-1903), who transported freedom seekers at night in his father's lumber wagon; Norman Allen (1805-1886), Able Fitch (1809-1851), and Lonson Wilcox (1802-1883), who were part of Battle Creek operative Erastus Hussey's network; and Seymour Treadwell, (1795-1867), who hid freedom seekers in his barn. Freedom seeker Emma Nichols (1830-1916), who came to Jackson on the Underground Railroad from Virginia, is also buried in the cemetery. Jackson was a well-established thoroughfare of the Underground Railroad and these individuals' involvement is documented in autobiographies, newspaper articles, reminiscences and archival collections. Since many of the homes and other structures that bear witness to these eight individuals no longer remain in Jackson, the cemetery--the city's oldest--is the best tangible site to commemorate their participation."

    "ABSTRACT":"Stephen Smith (c.1795-1873), a leading conductor on Pennsylvania's Underground Railroad, built this seaside summer home in Cape May, New Jersey in 1846, as a retreat from racial conflicts and disease outbreaks in Philadelphia, where he lived. He used it until his death in Philadelphia in 1873. His wife, Harriet Lee Smith (c.1796-1880) continued to use the home in the summers, until her death in this house in August 1880. Next to it was one of the only summer resorts for free blacks, the Banneker House, opened in 1845, which soon became the hub of summer life for Philadelphia's black abolitionist and Underground Railroad leaders. Smith, born enslaved, purchased his freedom, and set up a very successful coal and lumber company in Columbia, Pennsylvania. Smith was helping enslaved people who reached Columbia, PA as early as 1840. Columbia, with a large free-black population and the main bridge across the Susquehanna River, was a key destination for many people fleeing slavery in Maryland and Virginia. Smith, and his friend, relative and business partner, William Whipper, provided aide to these freedom seekers, with Whipper becoming station master in Columbia. Even after Smith moved to Philadelphia in 1842, their coal and lumber company was an important part of the Underground Railroad. They built hidden compartments in the 22 rail cars they owned and safely transported hundreds of people to Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. This house remains much as it was in Smith's day. Although we don't know at this time if the house itself was used for UGRR activity, it is an excellent location to tell Smith's UGRR story. Currently it is a private residence, although not used, and the owners plan to open it to the public once renovated."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Sandusky Library, a public library in Sandusky, Ohio, holds a significant collection of historical materials relating to the region and nation, including sources on the Underground Railroad (UGRR) and its important role in the area. The mission of the Library's historical departments is to collect and promote the history of Sandusky and the region, including significant events such as the Underground Railroad, particularly as it relates to local activities. The Library collects both primary sources (manuscripts, records, etc.) and secondary sources (books, videos, etc.) to support these subjects. Among the UGRR-related materials in the collections are: the legal judgment served against Rush Sloane in 1856 for assisting in the escape of enslaved men; a cane given to Sloane by grateful African American residents; locally-published papers and articles related to the UGRR, including articles from the regional journal Firelands Pioneer; photographs of participants and locations relevant to the UGRR in Sandusky; and other secondary sources. Additionally, local records and publications, including city directories and newspapers, are important aids for UGRR researchers. Sources are continually sought after to add to the collections. Sandusky Library is a key source of historical information for the region, both through its resources and presentations on historical topics."

    "ABSTRACT":"Located on the corner of Mulberry and Second Street in Ripley, Ohio, stands the home of Chambers Baird (1811-1887), an attorney who provided legal assistance to those involved in the Underground Railroad. His reputation as such was established by his documented involvement in two incidents. The first was the case of Mahan v. The Commonwealth of Kentucky (1838), in which Rev. John B. Mahan, of Sardinia, Ohio, 1 was tried in Mason County, Kentucky for assisting two freedom seekers who had escaped from there into Ohio. The other was the 1853 rescue of the Hensleys, a free black family (a father, mother, and 4 children) living in Brown County, Ohio, who were kidnapped from their home as €œfugitive slaves€ and taken to Kentucky. Dr. Thomas Smith Williamson (1800-1879), who owned the home prior to Baird, is also believed to have had connections to the Underground Railroad. The home is currently a private residence and not open to the public."

    "ABSTRACT":"LancasterHistory.org (LHO), established in 1886 as the Lancaster County Historical Society, exists to engage and educate the public about the people, places, and events that shaped Lancaster County within the context of the history of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the United States of America. LancasterHistory.org's archives include extensive materials that relate to the UGRR as it emerged as a highly-organized operation throughout the region. LHO provides the public with access to its extensive collections (more than 2 million objects, manuscripts, and documents) through research facilities, public history events, exhibitions, programs, and community partnerships. LHO's headquarters, the Lancaster Campus of History, contains a 35,000-square foot museum and research facility (expanded and renovated in 2013), as well as Wheatland, the home of President James Buchanan (President in the years immediately preceding the Civil War). In 2020, LHO will embark on a project to develop and interpret the home and law office of Congressman Thaddeus Stevens (a Site in the Network to Freedom). Stevens is regarded as a key advocate in the drafting and eventual enactment of the 13th and 14th Amendments to the US Constitution, was a staunch abolitionist, and used his home and connections as means to further the activity of the Underground Railroad."

    "ABSTRACT":"In 1777, Abraham Bayard, a thirty-year-old enslaved man, fled from Samuel Bayard on Maryland's Eastern Shore. Living and working on a 300 acres plantation along the Bohemia River in Cecil County owned by Samuel, Abraham took advantage of the chaos and tension of the American Revolution to seize his liberty. On November 7, 1775, John Murray, the royal governor of Virginia and a Loyalist, declared martial law in that colony and proclaimed that any enslaved person who joined the British armed forces to fight American patriots would receive their freedom. Known as Lord Dunmore's Proclamation, the declaration struck alarm beyond Virginia and the Chesapeake, stoking fears of slave rebellions all over the Mid-Atlantic. Dunmore's tactic to weaken revolutionaries' resources inspired thousands of enslaved people to flee their enslavers. British ships controlled the Chesapeake Bay early in the war, and their raids on farms and plantations wreaked havoc on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. Patriot revolutionaries lost livestock, food stores, and enslaved labor. Abraham, with easy access to the Bay via the Bohemia and Elk Rivers, fled to the British brig Nesbitt, which had been conducting raids throughout the area. Abraham settled in Nova Scotia, Canada, after the war. Maryland's Department of Natural Resources now owns a portion of this former plantation, establishing a new park called Bohemia River State Park in 2018. Historic structures from Bayard's time are no longer extant, though some 19th century buildings have survived, including a stone building dated 1824-1840."

The Griers were the first family to provide refuge and support to the Still family north of the Ohio River, and Charles Grier transported them to the next stop along the Underground Railroad. While the old church on the site, which at one time the Griers attended, has collapsed, the Antioch Cemetery is still an active graveyard and is well maintained by the Antioch Church and Cemetery Association."

Thornton was hired out to Wurts & Reinhard's store on Main Street at the corner of Fourth, while Lucie was enslaved by the Backus merchant family from Connecticut. Upon the Backus' deaths, Lucie was auctioned off June 22, 1831, to Virgil McKnight. Destined for the \"fancy girl\" markets at the foot of the Mississippi, Lucie and her husband staged a daring daylight escape by steamboat on July 3, 1831. They settled in Detroit but were discovered in 1833 by their Kentucky owners. They were sentenced to return to slavery when the African American community rescued them in the Blackburn Riots of 1833, the first racial riots in Detroit. The Blackburns were sent to Canada. Their extradition case was the first between Canada and the US over freedom-seekers and resulted in changes to British Colonial Canada's extradition laws that endure to this day. The Marker, dedicated April 26, 2002, for this story is being nominated. It's located on the sidewalk and stands at the former site of Wurt's & Reinhard's drygoods business at 4th and Main, (no longer extant) where Thornton was hired out and working at the time of his and Lucie's escape."

    "ABSTRACT":"The site nominated is the burial site in the New Almshouse Cemetery, of freedom seeker Mrs. Nancy Adams (C. 1771-1859), who was buried within the Almshouse Cemetery. Her remains were re-interred in the New Almshouse Cemetery in 1995. Born on Maryland's Eastern Shore, Mrs. Nancy Adams first escaped around the age of twenty, into nearby woods with her husband and two children. After five months, the family was located and persuaded to return by a new slaveholder, Jesse Waters. Mrs. Adams, was \"sold south\" with her children and traveled, first overland, then by water to Port Gibson, Mississippi. A daughter, died on the journey. Mrs. Adams worked decades in Louisiana's cotton fields. Her 19-year old son received 400 lashes and was \"salted and peppered.\" She wrote, \" . . . I was treated as bad as was possible and live . . . my eyes have seen what my tongue dares not speak.\" In €œfeeble health€ she hired herself out. On a trip to Nor-wich, Connecticut she managed her second escape and hid for two days in an ice house (Adams, Par-sons). Her third escape came as her former slaveholder sought her. She found safety in Uxbridge, Massachusetts. Recent studies of Mrs. Adams remains reveal a woman who suffered from a tragic and difficult life and with severe disabilities. She lived a very great age and died at the Uxbridge Almshouse where she was buried (Elia, et al.)."

Across the various projects within the online archive, detailed below, are public and government documents related directly to the Underground Railroad, most importantly over 17,000 court documents from across the South and over 4800 North Carolina runaway slave ads. The three on-line collections include: Race and Slavery Petitions Project, North Carolina Runaway Slave Advertisement Project and People Not Property Project (underway). DLAS is housed at the UNCG University Libraries, which contains over 1.2 million physical items in its collections and provides access to millions of digital items from commercial database vendors. The University Libraries also provides free and open access to its own digitized archival collections, created from its own materials and from those belonging to community partners. Project staff are onsite between 8AM and 5PM Monday through Friday, year-round except state holidays, and are also available via telephone and email.

    "ABSTRACT":"The Gist Settlement in Eagle Township, Brown County, Ohio, historical marker is located in the Five Points Cemetery (aka the Methodist Colored Cemetery). This Gist Settlement, established in 1819, served as a refuge for those who €œran€ to become free men and women. The settlement was comprised of emancipated slaves from Virginia who had been freed by the will of Samuel Gist (1723-1815) and resettled in Ohio. Residents of the settlement saw the need to sacrifice themselves so that other enslaved ones might have that same grace. Both oral history and written accounts detail the settlement's participation in the Underground Railroad. The most well-known operative from the community was John D. Hudson, who worked in concert with white Underground Railroad operatives from nearby Ripley, Sardinia, and Red Oak. The settlement was also a target for kidnappers and there are documented cases of unsuccessful attempts to carry off residents on the reverse Underground Railroad. The €œGist Settlement€ Ohio Historical Marker (10-8) was originally placed in 2009, and replaced in 2010."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Peter Wentz Farmstead, built between 1744 and 1758, is a historic house and farm located in Montgomery County, PA. The Wentz family lived on the property throughout the American Revolution. The Farmstead was initially preserved because of its association with General George Washington, who planned the Battle of Germantown while staying at the Wentz farm in October 1777. However, further research has revealed another vital aspect of the property's history; its association with Jack, who was one of two enslaved people living and working on the property between 1766 and 1774. He fled from the Farmstead twice in pursuit of liberty. Following both attempts Peter Wentz placed runaway slave advertisements in the Pennsylvania Gazette for his capture and return. After his first attempt, Jack was jailed in Burlington, N.J. before being returned to the Farmstead. After his second escape, he disappears from the historical record, leaving us questioning whether he found freedom. Using period tax records and newspaper advertisements to chronicle this important history at the Farmstead lends an excellent view into the existence of enslaved people in Pennsylvania as well as of inherent conflicts in the social structure that allowed the practice."

    "ABSTRACT":"First Presbyterian Church of Green Bay, Wisconsin (now known as Union Congregational United Church of Christ), established in 1835, is documented to have twice sheltered freedom seekers in the mid-1850s. In the first instance, the church gave sanctuary to a man and his children. Detailed information about these freedom seekers does not survive in the historical record. However, we do know that the members of this family made their way to freedom in Wisconsin, where they found sanctuary in Stockbridge, founded by the Stockbridge Indians. When slave hunters tracked them there, putting them at risk of re-enslavement, they found sanctuary thirty-five miles further north in Green Bay, Wisconsin's First Presbyterian Church. The church's minister from 1840-1858, Reverend Jeremiah Porter (1804-1893), and his wife, Eliza Chappell Porter (1807-1888), assisted by members of the congregation, sheltered them in the church belfry for several days. When the steamboat Michigan arrived in Green Bay's harbor, commanded by Captain Stewart, a known abolitionist, the family boarded the steamer and reached freedom in Canada. The Porters later sheltered a freedom-seeking €œgirl€ in their parsonage, which was adjacent to the church. The Underground Railroad activity that took place at First Presbyterian Church is commemorated on a historical marker that stands outside of Union Congregational United Church of Christ, successor to First Presbyterian Church."

    "ABSTRACT":"First Presbyterian Church of Racine, Wisconsin is a Greek Revival style church built in 1852. However, the church's history dates back to its organization in 1839, when it was founded, in part, by a core group of strongly outspoken abolitionists, whose activities included participation in the Underground Railroad. In the years leading up to the Civil War, the church became known as an abolitionist institution, both for the resolve of the congregation as a whole, and by the actions of individual leaders and members, most notably Hiram Foote (1808-1889) and Sylvester B. Peck (1811- 1893). This assertion is supported by organizational documents including governing body minutes, personal correspondence, memoirs, rosters, contemporary reports and histories comprised in part of first-person accounts. Some of this documentation suggests that the church itself provided a refuge for freedom seekers. This early commitment to the noble cause of the abolition of slavery and the Underground Railroad resonates throughout the congregation's history. The First Presbyterian Church of Racine continues to foster a steadfast commitment to social justice. As Rev. Ben Johnston-Krase stated on the occasion of their 175th Anniversary, and upon reflection of the congregation's history, €œWe don't go to church. We are the church.€ The church, designed by architect and church elder, Lucas Bradley was listed on the National Register of Historical Places in 1973."

    "ABSTRACT":"During the Battle of Chickamauga, September 18-20, 1863, thousands of African Americans, such as Jack Hines and Thomas Cole, risked their freedom as Union Army laborers while the battle raged around them. Once the Confederate Army retreated from Missionary Ridge, the city of Chattanooga was open for freedom seekers, including Benjamin Holmes, to flee from enslavement into the city. Many of those who escaped were \"body servants\" for Confederate soldiers engaged in the fight. Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park was established in 1890 and was the first National Military Park in the National Park Service. Through researching and interpreting the causes and consequences of the Civil War, Park researchers uncovered exciting stories that reflect the broad spectrum of the American experience, most notably has been the story of African Americans who lived within the current park boundaries before, during, and after the Civil War. Today the park tells the stories of these freedom seekers in and around the park through tours, multi-media products, and partnership programs with the Bessie Smith Cultural Center in Chattanooga."

Facilitated by National Parks of Boston staff, this program utilizes Audience Centered Engagement techniques rooted in primary source materials. The program's six stops on Georges Island offer different vantage points of the harbor overlooking sites tied to daring maritime escapes, successful evasion of slave catchers, as well as some tragic stories of capture and rendition. Through these dramatic experiences activated in the authentic spaces in which the events took place, visitors discover and discuss this often-overlooked history of the harbor and are encouraged to find contemporary relevance in their own lives."

Lowell Historical Society's (1868) collections are also housed and managed by the Center for Lowell History. Through extensive research efforts, Lowell-based resources were identified and/or acquired creating an UGRR and Slavery Collection: books, published works, images, manuscripts, maps, atlases, newspaper articles, vital records, and census records. The UGRR Collection has been and is used by faculty members, students, researchers, and the general public for curriculum, exhibits, film, news-articles, panel discussions, reports, TV, walking, tours, waysides, wikipedia entries, and other projects. For many years, Lowell's Underground Railroad and the men and women involved have been an area of research. Citizens of Lowell assisted men and women out of slavery and provided a destination for freedom seekers.

Review of property ownership over time shows that the park retains 814 acres, more or less, of the original 1,146 acres of the former Chew/Paca planation named Turkey Point Farm, and the Turkey Point Light Station. Additionally, the park is comprised of 1,100 acres that contain Mauldin Mountain plantation, Bull Mountain farm and other properties. Most plantation owners in the area used enslaved persons. Freedom seekers were documented fleeing from the Chew/Paca planation. The Turkey Point Light Station was used as a guidepost for freedom seekers navigating the Chesapeake Bay and Elk River, north to freedom. The Turkey Point Farm and Turkey Point Light Station are being nominated for inclusion in the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Stephen Bogue House and Marker, located in Cassopolis, MI, was the home of Quaker abolitionists Stephen Bogue (1790-1868) and his second wife Hannah East Bogue (1798-1891). The couple arrived in 1831, built a cabin, and began sheltering freedom seekers soon after that. In 1843 Bogue began holding meetings of the Young's Prairie Anti-Slavery Society in his home. The Bogues' participation in the Underground Railroad comes from both primary and secondary sources, documenting their home not only as a station, but a destination on the Underground Railroad. The Bogue family provided jobs, financial assistance, homes, and protection to men, women, and children that came to Young's Prairie, on their journeys to freedom. The strongest evidence of their participation comes from freedom seeker Perry Sanford, who later recounted that he was staying in a cabin on the Bogue property when Kentucky slave catchers broke in, resulting in what came to be known as the 1847 Kentucky Raid. The slave catchers' efforts were unsuccessful, however, in 1849 angered over their losses they sued for damages under the 1793 Fugitive Slave Law. Stephen Bogue was named as a defendant in the case. The house is currently owned by the Underground Railroad Society of Cass County (URSCC) and is open for tours, June through September, Mon-Fri 1-4pm. The marker, installed in 1931, is located east of the home and is available for viewing 24/7. Note: This application was originally submitted for Round 14 in 2007. This amendment includes a change to include the Stephen Bogue House which was not included as part of the original listing which was just for the marker and a change in ownership."

The Public Square originally comprised the four corners of the intersection of Jackson Street (today North Jackson Street) and Main Street (today West Michigan Avenue). The northeast quadrant of the square, was the site of three newspapers: The Jacksonburg Sentinel, co-founded in 1837 by Underground Railroad activists William DeLand and Norman Allen; the American Freeman, founded in 1838-39 by Underground Railroad activist William Sullivan; and the Michigan Freeman, founded in 1839 by Underground Railroad activist Seymour Treadwell. The American Citizen, founded in 1849 by Underground Railroad activist Charles DeLand was located in the southeast quadrant of the square. The editorial content of these papers unleashed a war of words against slavery that pulsated throughout the village, the state, and even the nation. The Citizen openly promoted the Underground Railroad. The papers, which existed from a few years to several decades, faced financial hardships, destruction of property and persecution. Today, the newspapers are memorialized by a Michigan Historical Marker and a display in Bucky Harris Park, making the park an appropriate place to honor their connection to the Underground Railroad."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Watkins Farm, located in Brooklyn, Michigan, was the property of early settler Royal Watkins (1788-1876), who was involved in the Underground Railroad. In 1847, Kentucky slave trader/owner George Brasher [aka Brazier] led a posse of men to the Watkins farm to capture self-freed John White, formerly known as Felix White. Famous Underground Railroad operative, Laura Smith Haviland, documented in her autobiography the brazen planning and execution of a kidnapping mission on free soil. Brasher sent his lawyer to locate White, then assembled a posse of seven men who surrounded a field on Watkins Farm. The Kentuckians were told they'd find White there at work. Instead, the kidnappers were stunned to find that Royal Watkins had tricked them. Watkins had managed John White's escape and said, €œI suppose he is in Canada, as I took him, with his trunk, to the depot, yesterday, for that country.\" Watkins, fervently opposed to slavery, employed African and Native Americans during the antebellum period and family descendants believe the barn was used a safe hiding place. The property is now preserved as the Watkins Lake State Park & County Preserve of 1,122 acres. The tranquility of the fallow fields belies the day a man was nearly captured at gunpoint to be taken to a slave state to be sold. While the 1864 house is not included as part of this site, the fields remained as farmland for over a century and are now open to the public."

    "ABSTRACT":"Established in 1857, the Table Rock Cemetery, located in Table Rock, Nebraska, is the final resting place of nine persons who helped freedom seekers in the Underground Railroad. Although most freedom seekers who traveled through Nebraska kept close to the Missouri River, the winds of adversity sometimes blew them west as far as Table Rock, 25 miles away, where they were provided assistance by various area residents, including six buried here: Charles Woodbury €œC.W.€ Giddings (1810-1879) and his wife Clarissa Griffing Giddings (1817-1880), who lived in town with their four daughters, including the oldest, Fannie (1841-1935). To the east of town lay three new farms, those of Asa E. Heywood (1838-1912), John C. Wood (1835-1912), and William Fellers (1834-1906). These settlers arrived between 1856 and 1858 and aided freedom seekers on least two occasions, and reportedly many more. Also at rest in the Table Rock Cemetery are three persons who came after the Civil War, Joseph Benedict Pepoon (1838-1921), his sister Mary Pepoon Howe (1831-1903), and Mary's husband Orville Duane Howe (1831-1917). In their youths in the 1840s, their family homes near Painesville, Ohio served as stations on the Underground Railroad."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Gist Settlement in Scott Township, Brown County, Ohio Historical Marker is located on Wahlsburg Road in the fenced enclosure of a water tower in Georgetown. This Gist Settlement, established in 1819, served as a refuge for those who €œran€ to become free men and women. The settlement was comprised of emancipated slaves from Virginia who had been freed by the will of Samuel Gist (1723-1815) and resettled in Ohio. Residents of the settlement saw the need to sacrifice themselves so that other enslaved ones might have that same grace. Both oral history and written accounts detail the settlement's connection to the Underground Railroad. However, the only resident to be identified in a specific incident was Benjamin Viercy, who was involved in the 1838 escape of a freedom seeker named Nelson from Mason County, Kentucky. The settlement was not only a place where freedom seekers sought refuge. Because it was populated by people of African descent, it also became a target for unscrupulous kidnappers. There are documented cases of unsuccessful attempts to carry off residents on the reverse Underground Railroad. The Gist Settlement in Scott Township, Brown County, Ohio Historical Marker (11-8) was placed in 2010. It was sponsored by the Freed Gist Slaves Descendants Foundation and the Ohio Historical Society (now Ohio History Connection)."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Pines, located at 721 East Baltimore Pike, in Kennett Twp, Chester County, Pennsylvania served as a stop along the Underground Railroad. Currently, situated on 2 1/2 acres, the Pines is a Federal Style Home built circa 1823. Its role in the Underground Railroad is traced to the participation of two Quaker families that owned the property- the Fussells and the Darlingtons. In the years leading up to the Civil War, the Kennett area of Chester County was known as a hotbed of abolitionism and Underground Railroad activity. Many of its residents provided assistance to freedom seekers, risking their own personal freedom, their reputations and their livelihood. Among these operatives was husband and wife, Dr. Bartholomew (1794-1871) and Lydia Morris Fussell (1804-1840), who purchased the Pines in 1827. Dr. Fussell is estimated to have assisted more than 2,000 freedom seekers. In 1841, the home was purchased by Chandler (1800-1879) and Hannah Darlington (1808-1890), who also offered assistance to those fleeing slavery. The Pines sat vacant and was in danger of demolition, until 2016, when Kennett Township purchased the property and began extensive exterior renovations to secure the integrity of the property."

He was active in abolitionist causes, subscribing to the Anti-Slavery Bugle and signing a petition to rally Beaver County voters to elect anti-slavery candidates to the Republican convention. In October 1846, two local African American brothers, both children under 10, were kidnapped from the community. Robert Townsend was the chairman of the committee organized to rescue the kidnapped Dawson brothers. The younger brother died as a result of his ordeal. William Henry €œLem€ Dawson spent nine years, following his rescue in Kentucky, living with Townsend at his home. In 1852, a newspaper notice in the Allegheny City Enterprise and Lancaster Gazette implicated Robert Townsend in a potential Underground Railroad operation, to ship €œapples€ to Allegheny. Today it is the J&J Spratt Funeral Home."

    "ABSTRACT":"Fort Negley Park, located in Nashville, Tennessee, was constructed from August through December of 1862 by more than 2700 conscript laborers. Most of the laborers were free Blacks and freedom seekers who had recently fled enslavement. The fort was the largest inland masonry fortification in North America and part of a complex system of defensive fortifications designed to protect the Union garrison from Confederate attack during the Civil War. Despite miserable working conditions and poor treatment, the recently enslaved, then called contrabands, recognized the significance of federal occupation. With no guarantees of freedom, thousands flooded into Nashville in search of protection and opportunity. Although they encountered disease, prejudice, hunger, and indifference, contrabands provided vital labor to the army for little or no pay. They worked as teamsters, woodcutters, cart drivers, stonemasons, cooks, laundresses, and nurses. Men recruited into colored regiments at Fort Negley served as guards along railroad lines and as frontline troops at the Battle of Nashville on December 15 and 16, 1864. Fort Negley has developed interpretive programs and projects highlighting the park as a birthplace of freedom. Considered hallowed ground by the local African American community and others, Fort Negley was recognized in 2019 as a Site of Memory as part of the UNESCO's Slave Route Project. "

    "ABSTRACT":"Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park's most notable Underground Railroad (UGRR) story comes from heavily wooded park property on Moccasin Bend on the west end of Chattanooga, Tennessee, where at least one enslaved person, a man named Jacob Cummings, escaped in July 1839. Cummings later became an important agent on the UGRR. Numerous farms dotted Moccasin Bend shortly after the Cherokee Indians lost the territory in 1819, and Jacob Cummings was one of the enslaved people working there. The Federal Road, established in 1805, passed across Moccasin Bend to Brown's Ferry as a major trade route in the region. This road and ferry site served as the escape route for Cummings and likely many other freedom seekers in the antebellum period. Cummings' journey was not without incident. He was captured multiple times, but escaped. He lived in Indiana for a year, where he attended school. He next moved to Michigan and, after four years on the run, he crossed the river to Canada. Cummings met Henry Bibb, another freedom seeker from Kentucky. Cummings eventually became an agent on the UGRR operating out of the DePuce settlement in Ontario. He remained in Canada until the outbreak of the Civil War. After the war, he moved to Columbus, Ohio, where he was interviewed by historian Wilbur Siebert in 1894 for Siebert's groundbreaking 1898 book, \"The Underground Railroad from Slavery to Freedom.\""

The museum also documented two other unnamed freedom seekers who traveled through the site and four other parties who all used the B&O Railroad to seek freedom. For many freedom seekers, the use of words like railroad, conductor, and station were euphemisms to describe the network of allies, rest stops, and modes of travel used on the Underground Railroad. However, the railroad, a new technology, changed the way both free and enslaved Americans sought movement and freedom in a very real way. Mt. Clare, a 40-acre Historic Landmark in Baltimore, is where America's first commercial railroad €“ the Baltimore and Ohio (B&O) Railroad €“ was founded in 1827. The Mt. Clare site was the headquarters as well as the freight and passenger terminus for all trains from points south and west. In addition to the courageous actions of freedom seekers, the actions €“ or deliberate inactions €“ made in the corporate offices of the B&O also shaped the experiences of freedom seekers taking the B&O Railroad.",

    "ABSTRACT":"The Castillo, part of Castillo de San Marcos National Monument, located in St. Augustine, Florida, was a destination for freedom seekers. Africans both free and enslaved were part of this community from its founding in 1565. Enslaved Africans made their way from the English colonies of North America to Spanish Florida, where they could gain freedom through Catholic baptism and by contributing to the community. Many of the men became soldiers. The first freedom seekers arrived in 1687 and worked to build the Castillo itself. Over the next 100 years, they and their descendants formed militias that were integral in defending the fort and the city from multiple British invasions. Without their efforts, St. Augustine and the Castillo may very well have fallen to the enemy. St. Augustine continued to be a haven for freedom seekers until 1790, when the King bowed to pressure from the U.S. and ended the sanctuary policies. The Castillo is the oldest masonry fortification in the continental United States, and one of only two fortifications in the world made from coquina. Constructed to protect the city of St. Augustine, which was established to defend Spanish shipping lanes in the Atlantic, the Castillo is the cornerstone upon which this colonial Spanish community was able to build and thrive."

    "ABSTRACT":"Fort Pickens, a massive masonry outpost located eight miles southwest of Pensacola, Florida, on Pensacola Bay, became a destination for freedom seekers starting in 1861. Eight enslaved people sought their freedom at the fort one month before the start of the Civil War. The commanding Union officer, however, sent them back to slavery. A few months later, an enslaved couple seeking freedom were allowed to stay, and the fort, which remained in Union control throughout the war, became the destination for countless freedom seekers fleeing slavery from the Gulf Coast of the Confederacy. In 1864, elements of the 25th United States Colored Troops marched into the fort. From Fort Pickens, these black soldiers fought to defend the Union and destroy slavery.  Today, Fort Pickens, which was built between 1829 and 1834 by a crew of predominately enslaved laborers, is preserved and protected by the National Park Service as part of Gulf Islands National Seashore. Day or seasonal passes can be purchased at the entry gate to the Fort Pickens Area.\n\n"

    "ABSTRACT":"Four Holes Swamp located near Harleyville, South Carolina, was a destination for numerous freedom seekers before and during the Civil War. Four Holes, along with other swamps in the area, make up a massive watershed feeding the Edisto River as it flows into the Atlantic Ocean south of Charleston. There were several plantations located near Four Holes. Owners placed numerous ads seeking runaways. One freedom seeker, Abram, was absent for two years from a local plantation and known to have sheltered in Four Holes for a large part of that time. Wherever there was slavery, freedom seekers escaped to nearby swamps for freedom, to gather additional food supplies, or to be close to family members on nearby plantations. Many freedom seekers banded together and built maroon communities deep in the harsh safety of the swamplands. Today, visitors can walk along the boardwalk trail and experience the swamp as it would have been when those seeking freedom found refuge in the swamp."

    "ABSTRACT":"Established in 1837, the Denmark Cemetery is located in the town of Denmark, Lee County, Iowa.1  It is the final resting place of men and women who at times put their lives at risk to assist those escaping slavery.\nNew England Congregationalists, whose religious belief was that God created mankind equal and slavery was inherently wrong, settled the town, and established the church, cemetery, and the Denmark Academy. From the beginning, the community actively worked against slavery. Some 15 to 20 families were directly engaged in either harboring or conveying the slaves to places of safety in their flight to freedom. In 1840 Rev. Asa Turner and two-thirds of his congregation launched Iowa Territory's first abolitionist organization, the Denmark Anti-slavery Society.2  The following Underground Railroad operatives, many of which were church members and signed members of the society, are buried in the Denmark Cemetery:  Oliver Brooks and Eliza Brooks, William Cooper and Ruth Flint Edwards Cooper,  Lewis Epps and Lucy Edwards Epps, Samuel Houston and Catherine Hornby Houston,  Nathan Isbell, Jr., Francis Sawyer, Jr. and Abbien €œAbbie€ Holt Sawyer, Dr. George Shedd and Theron Trowbridge and and Annis Chappel Case.\nThe Denmark Cemetery is presently an active, well-maintained cemetery. In addition to an endowment, the cemetery is funded by stockholders, county tax money, private donations and memorials. "

    "ABSTRACT":"The Cass County Underground Railroad Tour is a self-guided driving tour developed by the Underground Railroad Society of Cass County in 2011. The tour features 19 stops, in a 4-mile radius of Vandalia, Michigan, and includes the Stephen Bogue House and Marker, which is already listed in the Network.\nTour stops highlight the important roles Quakers, African Americans, and other abolitionists played in the area's Underground Railroad. Two routes converged in Vandalia, Michigan in the mid-1800s: The \"Quaker line\" from the Ohio River and Kentucky and the \"Illinois line\" from St. Louis and the Mississippi River. The Quakers, had moved to the area around 1830, and acted as stationmasters and conductors. One of the most noteworthy events that happened was the 1847 Kentucky Slave Raid, which achieved national attention and resulted in prosecution of Underground Railroad operatives under the 1793 Fugitive Slave Law. The raid involved many of these UGRR stations, as well as other sites, which are featured on this tour. As was the pattern in other locations, African American settlement developed in proximity to the Quaker settlement. These African Americans who had achieved their freedom through both legal and extra-legal means, helped others to secure their freedom.\nThe tour has been operated by the Underground Railroad Society of Cass County (URSCC), a 501c3, since 2011. The mission of the URSCC is to research and educate the public about the Underground Railroad in Cass County MI, and to preserve and restore local UGRR sites as focal points for telling this story\n"

    "ABSTRACT":"John Felix White, a freedom seeker, was laid to rest in Fairview Cemetery in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He died free, but bearing memories of forced migrations, of a wife and children left in bondage, arrest and imprisonment, and many losses.\nAfter self-emancipating in 1844, White traveled the Underground Railroad through Indiana to Michigan, where abolitionist Laura Haviland helped him get to Canada. A brief time later, he returned to Adrian, Michigan, attending the integrated and coeducational Haviland Institute the winter term of 1845. That summer, he sought help from Quaker Levi Coffin in Indiana to rescue his wife and children in bondage in Kentucky. After several disappointing months on the Ohio River, White returned alone, continuing his education.\nIn 1847, hoping to earn money to fund another rescue attempt, he found work nearby on the farm of Royal Watkins in Brooklyn, Michigan [listed in the NTF]. However, his slaveholder arrived with a plan to kidnap him, but with help from Laura Haviland, Royal Watkins, and other citizens, the armed Kentuckians' plans were foiled and White was not recaptured.\nAfter his narrow escape, White dared another rescue of his family. Unsuccessful, White was captured and imprisoned. Abolitionists paid his fine and White settled in Canada where he remarried and started a new family. By 1860, he and his family had returned to Michigan, residing in various places in the southeastern part of the state and eventually settling in Ann Arbor. Here he resided on the same street where the home of Underground Railroad operative Rev. Guy Beckley was located [listed in the NTF].\nIn 1905, John Felix White passed away in his daughter's home in Oakland County, but was buried in Fairview Cemetery, located near his former home in Ann Arbor.\nFairview is still an active cemetery.

It is the final resting place of Henry (c. 1825-1889) and Louisa Picquet (c.1828-1896), emancipated African Americans who were active on the Underground Railroad (UGRR) in Cincinnati before moving to New Richmond. They belonged to Zion Baptist, an anti-slavery African American church that was the €œheadquarters of the underground railroad.€ Evidence of their participation comes from Louisa's narrative, Louisa Picquet, the Octoroon: or Inside Views of Southern Domestic Life (1861), which she dictated to Rev. Hiram Mattison (1811-1868). According to Louisa, many freedom seekers came through their home, one of which was a woman named Mary White who eventually ended up in Canada.\nIn 1867, the Picquets moved to New Richmond, where they would spend the rest of their lives.\nSamarian Cemetery is no longer an active cemetery.\n"

    "ABSTRACT":"\nEstablished in the late 18th century and believed to be the earliest Black church established west of the Alleghenies, Macedonia Missionary Baptist Church, in Burlington, Ohio, played an important role in the Underground Railroad. Situated at Ohio's southernmost point, in Lawrence County, across the Ohio River from Virginia (now West Virginia), the area was a haven for Blacks who had been born free, emancipated by their slaveholders, or self-emancipated by escaping on the Underground Railroad. Sometime between 1811 and 1813, after a period of worshipping in their homes, the congregation constructed a small church. Through the mid-19th century, the black population of the area continued to grow. In 1849, a group of emancipated slaves known as the €œBurlington 37,€ settled into the community and helped build the church on Macedonia Hill, which currently stands. The church was the religious and social focal point of the area. The church's leadership and members assisted freedom seekers in a variety of ways, even welcoming them to reside in the community. The church also had strong, frequently familial connections, to other free Black communities in the region that were active on the Underground Railroad. Macedonia was the €œMother Church€ of other Black Baptist churches that formed the Providence Anti-Slavery Baptist Association, all of which carried out Underground Railroad work.\nListed on the National Register of Historic Places, the church no longer has an active congregation.

    "ABSTRACT":"Union Baptist Cemetery in Cincinnati, established in 1864, is the oldest African American burial ground in Hamilton County, Ohio. It remains at its original location. As its name suggests, the cemetery was associated with the (African) Union Baptist Church, which was organized in 1831, making it the second oldest African American church in the city.\nIn the years before the Civil War, many black people escaping slavery from the south, travelled the Underground Railroad through Cincinnati. The travelers depended upon the assistance of local blacks to help them on their journey. Members of three local black churches, which included Union Baptist Church provided a safe haven for those seeking freedom.\nWhile the church is no longer in its location from the period of the Underground Railroad, the cemetery remains and is the final resting place of many individuals who were freedom seekers themselves and/or assisted with the movement. Some of the people of note are: husband and wife Rev. Peter Farley Fossett (1815-1901) and Sarah Mayrant Walker Fossett (1826-1906) and other members of the Fossett Family, Rev. Philip B. Ferguson (1824-1909), William P. Newman (1815-1866), Rev. David Leroy Nickens (1794-1838), Rev. Wallace Shelton (1810-1890), Susan Tinsely (1818-1903), and the Troy Family.\nThe efforts of these individuals in the Underground Railroad movement have been documented in newspaper articles, letters, and books.\nThe cemetery has a wealth of stories that must be shared. We must \"Remember, Educate and Celebrate\" those buried in Union Baptist Cemetery now and in the future."

Esther's story not only brings to light the Underground Railroad on Martha's Vineyard, but the enslavement of native peoples in colonial America.\nBecause the harbor was an important maritime port it is highly probable that other escapes occurred in the harbor. Especially since over time, a strong antislavery presence developed in the area."

    "ABSTRACT":"The William Still Interpretive Center shares the heart-wrenching story and legacy of Sidney Still's desperate choice in order to be free. Housed in an historic 1820s one room €œcottage€ relocated to the Caroline County, MD, 4-H Park on landscapes that were once part of Sidney Still's enslaver's farm on Edmondson's Reserve, the Still Center features a period €œslave cabin€ interior, exterior interpretive exhibits about the Still family, and a garden highlighting foodstuffs commonly cultivated by Eastern Shore enslaved people. Sidney and her husband Levin were once enslaved in Caroline County, but Levin was manumitted in 1798, while Sidney remained enslaved by Alexander €œSaunders€ Griffith. After Levin moved to New Jersey between 1804 and 1806, Sidney escaped with their four children €“ Peter, Levin Jr., Mahala and Kitty €“ but was later caught near Greenwich, NJ and returned to Griffith. After locking Sidney in the attic of a nearby brick home for 3 months as punishment, Saunders let her out. She fled again, taking Mahala and Kitty but leaving Peter and Levin Jr. behind. In retaliation, Griffith sold the two boys to Kentucky. Levin Jr. later died. It took forty years before Peter was reunited with his mother and siblings in New Jersey. From the late 1840s through the early 1860s, Sidney's son William Still, born in 1822, worked as the Secretary of the Vigilance Committee of the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society and managed one of the busiest Underground Railroad stations in Philadelphia. He documented more than 1,000 freedom seekers, including Harriet Tubman, who came through his office on their journeys North. It was his family's tragic separation that informed William's decision to record the names of freedom seekers so that separated family members could at a later time more easily reunite."

    "ABSTRACT":"In the third autumn of the Civil War, a freedom seeker named Henry voluntarily entered Union lines at the Barrancas, a rust-red promontory in Pensacola, Florida, wearing an iron bar riveted around his leg. At the Barrancas, the Federal government maintained a sprawling military reserve for recruiting, training, and staging soldiers for operations on the northern Gulf Coast. After his arrival, Henry became a soldier in the Union army men as part of the United States Colored Troops (U.S.C.T.),  Between 1863 and 1865, Black soldiers in the 25th, 82nd, 86th, and 97th U.S.C.T. participated in several expeditions into West Florida and South Alabama. The columns that sprang from the Barrancas (commonly known as Fort Barrancas) also carried deliverance to enslaved people in surrounding counties, some of whom followed their liberators back to Pensacola Bay."

    "ABSTRACT":"The British landed on Cumberland Island, Georgia in January 1815 and set up headquarters at the Dungeness Plantation.Due to a proclamation by British Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane, they freed the enslaved AfricanAmericans on the island and other freedom seekers began coming to the island from Georgia, South Carolina, Florida,and the Sea Islands. British ships took these formerly enslaved African Americans to Nova Scotia and Trinidad where they developed their own unique cultures and communities. Ned Simmons was one of the enslaved at the Dungeness. Briefly,he was free and enlisted in the Third Battalion of Colonel Marines, but after the Treaty of Ghent he was re-enslaved. Simmons and eighty others were sent back into slavery at the Dungeness Plantation.Today, Dungeness Plantation is part of the 206 acre Dungeness Historic District, home to the ruins of a Carnegie mansion. More than 200 years ago, Dungeness Plantation run by Louisa Shaw, the daughter of Revolutionary War hero Nathanael Greene. When the British occupied Cumberland Island in January 1815 in preparation for an attack on the mainland at Point Peter, they chose Dungeness as their headquarters. It had a large four-story mansion and the most enslaved African Americans on the island."

    "ABSTRACT":"In the early 1840s, the Knox County Courthouse in Knoxville, Illinois was the site of several legal cases that stemmed from the escape of five freedom seekers from the Randolph County farm of Andrew Borders in southern Illinois during the summer of 1842. The group of freedom seekers included Susan Borders, her sons Jarrot, Anderson, and Harrison, and another woman named Hannah Morrison. Captured in Knox County in early September, the freedom seekers were taken to Knoxville and held in the Knox County Jail. Eventually, Andrew Borders came north to retrieve them. While he acknowledged that Hannah was free, he claimed the other four as his indentured servants. Lacking proof of his claim, he returned south to get it. When he came back in November, he captured the children with the help of the sheriff. Susan was convinced by Galesburg abolitionists that they could get the children back and subsequently escaped to Galesburg. The children were held briefly in the jail, but the sheriff got them out and returned them to Randolph County. Between November 1842 and June 1844 charges and countercharges were heard in the Knox County Courthouse against Borders and against Knox County abolitionists for assisting in Susan's escape. Ultimately, none of the accused on either side were found guilty. The escape of these five freedom seekers and subsequent legal drama draws important attention to the existence of slavery in Illinois.Currently, the courthouse is owned by the city of Knoxville.  "

She and her husband Nat, along with fourteen other freedom seekers took their freedomin early October 1857.

[Nat replied,] €˜I have heard her say she would wade through blood and tears for her freedom.'€1The property includesthe house and outbuildings of theenslaverofLizzieAmby, Dr. Alexander Hamilton Baylyand dates to the 1740s. Although now on a long and narrow urban lot, the property associated with this house historically encompassed much of the block where it is located. Surviving to the rear of the house are several outbuildings. The oral tradition for one of these buildingsis that itwasa dwelling for enslaved people on the property."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Lewis and Harriet Hayden House at 66 Phillips (formerly Southac) Street on Beacon Hill served as the preeminent Underground Railroad safe house, or station,in Boston during the 1850s. In the 1840s, the Haydens escaped slavery in Kentucky and eventually settled in Boston. They lived in this house by 1850 and turned it into one of the most documented safe houses in the area. Lewis Hayden served as one of the most active members of the Boston Vigilance Committee, an organization dedicated to assisting freedom seekers. The records of thiscommittee document the Haydens sheltering and assisting scores of freedom seekers throughout the 1850s. The famous couple William and Ellen Craft stayed with the Haydens following their unique escape from slavery. Lewis also played a prominent role in the courthouse rescue of Shadrach Minkins in 1851 and the attempted rescue of Anthony Burns in 1854, both of whom had beenarrested under the provisions of the Fugitive Slave Law following their escapes from Virginia. Abolitionist and Vigilance Committee member, Henry Ingersoll Bowditch declared that the Hayden House served as €œthe temple of refuge for any hunted refugee from Southern slavery.€"

Affixed to the sides of the concrete monument are four brass plaques that speak to the village's and surrounding area's role in the struggle against slavery. Recognized on the monument are those who €œwrought€ and €œfought€ for liberty, including Ripley's best-known Underground Railroad operatives, Rev. John Rankin (1793-1886) andJohn Parker(c. 1827-1900). The monument establishes a clear link between the American Revolution, the Abolitionist Movement, and the Civil War, reading €œthe men who wrought for liberty were the forerunners of the abolitionist movement culminating in the Civil War. They were the intermediaries between the anti-slavery men of the American Revolution and the anti-slavery men of the Civil War period.€The monument was a gift of Frank Moody Gregg(1866-1937).According to Gregg, the monument's purpose was €œto rescue these men from oblivion and make themnational characters rather than of only local renown.€1Liberty Monument, a contributor to the Ripley Historic District, continues to play an important role in community remembrances and commemorations.

    "ABSTRACT":"Historic Brattonsville is an open-air living history museum located in York County, South Carolina. It was the escape site for at least four freedom seekers between 1849 and 1865: Bob escaped in 1849, Lewis and Henry escaped in 1851, and James Williams escaped in 1865. The Bratton Plantation was established in 1766 by William and Martha Bratton. It grew to the height of its productivity while owned by their youngest son, John Simpson Bratton Sr., and his wife,  Harriet Rainey. Like many planters in the Carolina Backcountry, the Brattons made the vast majority of their wealth off the backs of enslaved people producing short-staple cotton. Enslaved field hands at Brattonsville most likely would have worked in groups known as \"gangs\" that were monitored by an overseer, while the enslaved house servants spent the majority of their time in the main house or adjacent kitchen. Those enslaved people at Brattonsville lived in small brick or frame houses. Their diet would have primarily consisted of processed corn meal, flour, or hominy and smokehouse-cured pork supplemented by seasonal fruits and vegetables. Today, Brattonsville is comprised of eight original buildings and 33 relocated or reconstructed structures located on 781 acres."

    "ABSTRACT":"On September 9, 1739, about 20 enslaved men raided a store near here, taking guns and other weapons, and began what was the largest insurrection of enslaved peoples during the British occupation of North America. Led by Cato (or Jemmy) the group burned the store and killed the shopkeepers. The group, believed to be mostly Angolan, hoped to reach St. Augustine in Spanish Florida, which offered freedom to those who would become Catholic and fight for Spain. They waved banners, reminiscent of Angolan military practices, and chanted \"Liberty\" in time with drums as they called others to the cause. Stopping at plantations -- including the Rose and Elliott plantations located at the present day Caw Caw Interpretive Center -- they attacked the slaveholders, who, in some cases, were defended by other enslaved people like July. The group grew to more than 60 freedom seekers by the time they reached the Edisto River, where they engaged in battle with a local militia. Some freedom seekers were killed, others fled back to plantations, while an unknown number of others escaped. The event, which resulted in the death of 20 to 30 white people, resulted in the passing of the brutally oppressive 1740 Negro Act. Caw Caw Interpretive Center interprets the African Diaspora, Gullah Culture, the Low Country's agricultural practices and the legacy of the largest self-emancipation event in British Colonial North America.

    "ABSTRACT":"Leinster Bay Waterfront is a rocky .08 mile coastline between Leinster Bay Estate and Annaberg on Virgin Islands National Park in St John. During the time of the Danish West Indies this area was known as the Maho Bay Quarter. The Leinster Bay Waterfront was an escape site to Tortola for freedom seekers. The Waterfrontis one mile away from Tortola, British West Indies, where emancipation came in 1834 as opposed to emancipation in the Danish West Indies which came in 1848. In 1808, James Murphy was the largest sugar cane producer on St. John. He owned 494sugar cane acres and 662 enslaved workers. Leinster Bay Estateand adjacent Annaberg were his twolargestsugar plantations.By 1809 approximately 25% of the population of enslaved AfricansonSt John, lived and worked in Maho Bay Quarter. Sometime afteremancipation in the British West Indiesand before 1843 aguard house was built, to prevent runaways,on the Leinster Bay Estateoverlooking the Leister Bay Waterfront. Even with the guardhouse,from1834and 1848 approximately100 enslaved Africans fromSt John did manage to escape to Tortola, in the British West Indies. "

    "ABSTRACT":"The Nelson Hackett Project is a public humanities program that was launched in 2020 and located at the University of Arkansas Humanities Center in Fayetteville. The project documentsthe journey and legacy of Nelson Hackett, an enslaved man who fled Fayetteville in July 1841, made his way to Canada, and then became the only fugitive that Canada returnedto bondage in the U.S.Abolitionists throughout the Atlantic world, though,refused to allow Hackett's extradition to set a precedent and invoked his case to convince the British government to make such extraditions all but impossible. Hackett's flight,thus, helped ensure that Canada remained a refuge for fugitives from American slaveryand a viable destination for those on the Underground Railroad. Thecompletion of the first phase of the Nelson Hackett Projectresulted inan open-access website (https://nelsonhackettproject.uark.edu) that allows students,scholars, and the general publicto:1)Trace Hackett's flight from Arkansas to Canada;2)Studythe Canadian decision to allowHackett's extradition; 3)Chart Hackett's return to Arkansas and possible subsequent escape;4)Follow thedebates in Parliament provokedby Hackett's case and Britain's decision to make similar extraditions very unlikely.The website contains a narrative, primary source documents(with transcriptions), an interactive map, historical maps, and images."

    "ABSTRACT":"Boston: An Underground Railroad Hubis a digital exploration of Boston's long history as a center of Underground Railroad activity. Through an array of interactive maps, videos, articles, and other features, visitors are invited to learn about the freedom seekers whoescaped to Boston and the people whoassisted them. Housed on Boston African American National Historic Site's website, this project features a contextual essay and interactive story-maps following the lives of individual freedom seekers whocame to Boston. This project also features articles and videos that look at different aspects of the Underground Railroad,including the tragic case of Anthony Burns and the role of Boston Harbor in the Maritime Underground Railroad. Further, this project includes an expansive interactive mapthat showcases the people and places associated with the Underground Railroad network in the city. While introducing notable safe houses and Underground Railroad operatives, this map also highlights sites of public protest and concerted action against thefugitive slave laws, spaces tied to harrowing arrests and rendition, and places of heroic rescues. By elevating these once covert places and stories, this project encourages further exploration and engagement with Boston's unique role in this inspiring movement."

    "ABSTRACT":"Developed in 2018 by members of the Underground Railroad Society of Cass County (URSCC), the Cass Co. UGRR \"Wax Museum In A Box\"€ is a project-based learning program for 5th graders. The 5-step program introduces the Underground Railroad with a focus on Cass County, Michigan. Cass County was an important stop on the Underground Railroad. Quakers, African Americans, and other abolitionists played in the area's Underground Railroad. Two routes converged in Vandalia, Michigan in the mid-1800s: The \"Quaker line\" from the Ohio River and Kentucky and the \"Illinois line\" from St. Louis and the Mississippi River. The Quakers, had moved to the area around 1830, and served as important Underground Railroad operatives. One of the most noteworthy events that happened was the 1847 Kentucky Slave Raid, which achieved national attention and resulted in prosecution of Underground Railroad operatives under the 1793 Fugitive Slave Law. As was the pattern in other locations, African American settlement developed in proximity to the Quaker settlement. These African Americans who had achieved their freedom through both legal and extra-legal means, helped others to secure their freedom. As part of the program, students are given the opportunity to use their research, writing, and performance skills to develop a portrayal of a documented Cass County Underground Railroad activist and present as part of the Wax Museum at the Bonine House.

The library, located in the upstairs of the Bonine House, contains the research collections of six historians, who have helped document the area's role in the Underground Railroad, particularly as it pertains to 1847 Kentucky Slave Raid, which achieved national attention and resulted in prosecution of area Underground Railroad operatives under the 1793 Fugitive Slave Law. The library also contains other primary and secondary research that the URSCC has gathered since 2010, as well as regional, state and national information on the history of the Underground Railroad.Resources are accessible by visiting the library in-person, however, some are also available online at https://www.urscc.org/bonine-research-library.html . The Bonine House, built c. 1845, owned by the URSCC, was home to Underground Railroad operatives James E. Bonine and Sarah Bogue Bonine. It is a stop on the Cass County Underground Railroad Driving Tour, which is listed as a program in the Network to Freedom"

    "ABSTRACT":"Freedom seekers escaped from Fort Gaines on Dauphin Island during its construction, then later, during the Civil War, escaped to the fort. Runaway advertisements in local newspapers show that in 1857, a reward of $25 was offered for Eli, \"about 20 years of age, light in completion, about 5 feet ten inches high and slim appearance; hair rather inclined to curl, being heavy and bushy.\" In 1861, Alfred, about 26 years old, and Edmond, about 24, ran away together to the fort. Additionally, Fort Gaines is the location where five-time freedom seeker Wallace Turnage was taken after being rescued from Mobile Bay by the Union Navy. At Fort Gaines, he was presented with the choice to enlist or hire himself to a Union officer. Turnage chose the latter. Fort Gaines marks the conclusion of Wallace Turnage's bid for freedom. The beginning of his journey, the site of his former home located in downtown Mobile, Alabama, has also been added to the Network to Freedom. His journal was published in the book, \"A Slave No More.\""

    "ABSTRACT":"Hal's Kingdom marker, located just outside the village of Carlson, Alabama, recognizes Hal, a self-emancipated man and the maroon colony established under this leadership. Hal was a freedom seeker who escaped from his owner in Mississippi. He established the colony in the swamp of Clarke County, Alabama, at the convergence of the Tom Bigbee and Alabama Rivers. For years, Hal lived in the swamp and recruited other runaways to join him. In 1827, a member of the maroon colony revealed its location. Once discovered by local men, a gun battle ensued between the maroons and the white men seeking to capture them. Hal was shot and subsequently died from his injuries. Others were injured or killed, and some escaped. The maroons \"fought like Spartans\" in resistance to being re-enslaved, according to newspaper reports of the time. The lake where the colony settled is still referred to as Hal's Lake. The Lake is on private land.\n"

    "ABSTRACT":"Pensacola Pass, a shipping channel off the coast of Pensacola, Florida, served as a transportation route on the Underground Railroad in the mid-1800s. In1844, a white abolitionist named Jonathan Walker sailed seven freedom seekers \"including brothers Charles, Moses, Philip, and Leonard Johnson, Silas and Harry Scott, and Anthony Catlett,\" through the pass on their journey to the British Bahamas. Six years later, a freedom seeker named Adam secretly boarded a merchant ship traveling to New Hampshire. In 1859, Columbus Jones hid in the cargo of a merchant ship bound for free states in the North. Of the freedom seekers who used Pensacola Pass as their gateway to freedom, only Adam is known to have successfully escaped enslavement. Walker and the freedom seekers aboard his whale boat were seized and returned to Pensacola to face punishment. At Hyannis, on Massachusetts's Cape Cod, kidnappers seized Jones and forced him back into slavery. This waterway is accessible from the Fort Pickens Area of Gulf Islands National Seashore. "

Some of the enslaved escaped at least once, while others escaped numerous times. The Moravian missionaries were also located on his plantation. They were there to proselytize and instruct Cherokee children. Many of the runaway stories come from their journals. In 1809 at the age of 44, James Vann was murdered, and the day-to-day plantation management fell to his executor and overseer, Samuel Talley. His cruelty also led to slave flight. In 1817, James' son, Joseph Vann assumed control of the plantation. Escapes also occurred under his watch. In 1835, the Vann family along with the other Cherokees were forced west on the Trail of Tears to Oklahoma. The Vann House, currently 135 acres, became a Network to Freedom site in 2021. "

    "ABSTRACT":"Woodland Cemetery, established in 1851, located in Cleveland, Ohio is the final resting place of four individuals that were involved in the Underground Railroad: 1.  Sara Lucy Bagby (Johnson) (c. 1843-1906):  A freedom seeker who escaped in October 1860 from Wheeling, VA to  Cleveland, OH.  However, her whereabouts were uncovered by her owner, William Gorshorn, and after a trial in January of 1861, she was returned to slavery. She is recognized as one of the last freedom seekers to be returned to the south under the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act. 2.  John Brown (c. 1798-1869):  A wealthy African American Clevelander. Brown, who was free-born, was an abolitionist and Underground Railroad activist. His home and shop both served as stations on the Underground Railroad. 3.  Edward Wade (1803-1866):  A staunch abolitionist and a member of the U. S. House of Representative, he was a conductor and station master for the Underground Railroad.  Edward helped transport freedom seekers to Cleveland to move onward to freedom in Canada.  He also was one of six signatures that opposed the Nebraska-Kansas Act. 4.  Hiram Wilson (1803-1864):  A Lane Rebel, who was a devoted missionary to freedom seekers and an Underground Railroad activist in Canada."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Elk Ridge Furnace was a major site of industrial slavery in early America. One of the largest iron furnaces during the eighteenth century, its operation was conceived by its original owner, Caleb Dorsey, a prominent tobacco plantation owner, to maximize profits using a combination of enslaved, indentured, and convict labor. The furnace operated using this unfree labor system from 1755 until 1822. Work at Elk Ridge Furnace was brutal, and punishments were severe. At least five people enslaved at the Furnace have been documented attempting to escape these violent conditions, in cases that appeared as runaway advertisements in 18th century newspapers throughout the mid-Atlantic. In several cases, individuals escaped multiple times, suffering severe punishments and persisting in pursuit of freedom. This site highlights several underrepresented components of Underground Railroad history. It represents resistance to industrial slavery, which has received less robust public interpretation than more wellknown\ndepictions of enslavement, such as plantation slavery and domestic servitude. It provides evidence of eighteenth-century freedom seekers, whose efforts to escape have had less historic documentation than later cases. Finally, it follows several cases in detail and considers the strategies that individuals used to escape and collaborate with one another."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Henry Massey Escape Site, known historically as Stoopley Gibson Manor, is a plantation on Kent Island in Queen Anne's\nCounty, Maryland and the site of the 1849 escape of Henry Massey. Believed to have been born on the property in 1835, Massey\nwas fourteen when he successfully escaped to the North. After the death of his owner, James Bright, Massey's family was set to be split up in the estate settlement. Massey resolved to escape, and in October of 1849 he fled Kent Island and settled in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Unfortunately, Massey was later identified as a fugitive and arrested in Harrisburg on September 23rd, 1854. Two days later,\nMassey went before U.S. Commissioner E. D. Ingraham in Philadelphia for sentencing under the conditions of the Fugitive Slave\nLaw of 1850. Despite national press coverage, doubts as to the Bright's claim, and legal representation by the Pennsylvania\nAbolition Society, Massey was forcibly returned to Stoopley Gibson on October 5th, demonstrating the pro-slavery bias inherent in\nthe law. The Underground Railroad operative Samuel May later added Massey's story to The Fugitive Slave Law and its Victims, a\nprominent publication that denounced the law as the €œEnactment of Hell.€"

    "ABSTRACT":"During the mid-1800s, a 1 ½ block stretch of rail in Jackson, MI, connected a passenger depot on the west to a freight depot on the east, which provided access to and passage for freedom seekers escaping along the Michigan Central Railroad (MCRR) to Detroit. In 1847, the Crosswhite family accessed this rail corridor when they avoided recapture in Marshall, and made their way to Jackson, where they escaped by rail to Detroit. In addition, at least two escapes on the MCRR passed through Jackson's rail corridor. In 1854, 15 freedom seekers €œwere shipped off in a body on the cars of the Michigan Central Railroad,€ from Chicago to Detroit. In 1858-9, abolitionist John Brown and supporters shepherded a group of freedom seekers on the MCRR from Chicago to Detroit. Jackson's corridor wasn't simply one of many stops--it was a major hub and one of few cities offering regularly scheduled stops on the Chicago-Detroit line, a route that had no alternative but to pass through Jackson. Although the original depots no longer exist, the rail corridor on which freedom seekers traveled endures as a part of the existing rail system operated by Amtrak."

    "ABSTRACT":"Decatur Cemetery is the largest cemetery in the smallest township in Brown County, Ohio. It sits in the village of Decatur, which is the only village or town in Byrd Township. Decatur is the oldest village in the county, formed in 1801. Exactly when the cemetery was laid out and organized is unknown; the oldest tombstone found is for Lydia Ramey and her death date is December 20, 1822.Buried within the cemetery are two well-known local Underground Railroad operatives: Dr. Greenleaf Norton (1793-1869) and Rev. Jesse Lockhart (1793-1879). Both were very active though exact numbers of those they aided are not recorded. Dr. Norton lived in Decatur; Rev. Lockhart initially lived there upon coming to the area but he subsequently moved to nearby Russellville where he was pastor of the Presbyterian Church for 40 years. A third operative, Joseph T. €œPony€ Patton, is supposedly buried in Decatur Cemetery per his obituary from 1884 but no record of the burial has been found in existing cemetery records nor has a marker been located.Also buried in the cemetery are two freedom seekers who escaped during the Civil War. Lemuel Parker (c. 1850-1941) escaped slavery in Kentucky when he was twelve years old. Mrs. Phoebe Rice Duckins (d.1918) also fled enslavement in Kentucky and is buried in Decatur Cemetery along with her husband, Jerry, a Spanish-American War veteran.The cemetery is still in use."

    "ABSTRACT":"Seeley was perhaps the most prominent man of this neighborhood in the anti-slavery movement. He had a most fierce hatred of slavery, and his whole strength was exerted in the battle for its overthrow. In addition to participating in the Underground Railroad, he served as manager of the Ohio Anti-Slavery Society from 1836-39. He was present at the National Anti-Slavery Conventions and a delegate to the Free-Soil convention. Seeley continued his work for freedom and justice through the 1850s becoming a Vice President of the Kansas Emigration Aid Association of Northern Ohio. Uri Seeley's home which is now a private residence still stands proudly today as a representation of what once was an important part of his legacy and the Underground Railroad."

Their daring flight to freedom became an international sensation and a major boost to moral for those fighting slavery. Robert Smalls was born enslaved on April 5, 1839, in Beaufort, South Carolina. Smalls' enslaver, Henry McKee, sent him to Charleston at the age of 12 to be hired out. In his teen years, his love of the sea led him to work on the docks and wharves of Charleston. Smalls became a stevedore (dockworker), a rigger, a sail maker, and eventually a wheelman. In the fall of 1861, Smalls was assigned to steer the CSS Planter, a lightly armed Confederate military transport. On May 12, 1862, the Planter's three white officers decided to spend the night ashore. At about 3 a.m. the next morning, Smalls and seven of the eight enslaved crewmen executed their plan to sail the Planter to the Union blockade. Smalls dressed in the captain's uniform and wore a straw hat similar to that worn by the captain. He then guided the Planter out of what was then known as Southern Wharf, then stopped at a nearby wharf to pick up his own family and the families of other crewmen. The Seizure of the Planter Marker is located on a sidewalk at East Bay Street and Waterside along the Harbor Seawall Walkway in Charleston."

    "ABSTRACT":"Bowne House in Flushing, Queens was built circa 1661 and occupied by nine generations of\na Quaker family. It became a historic house museum in 1947 with original family furnishings\nand papers. Documents in the Bowne House Archives dated 1842-1850 reveal three Bowne\nHouse residents€”Samuel, Robert, and William Bowne Parsons€”were active in a network\nassisting multiple freedom-seekers.These brothers ran the Parsons Nursery while fundraising for the New York VigilanceCommittee and serving as conductors for multiple escapees on the Underground Railroad. Our letters document their respective contacts with prominent Underground Railroad activists such as Charles B. Ray, William Harned, and Simeon Jocelyn, officers of the Vigilance Committee; Henry Ward Beecher, preacher at Brooklyn's Plymouth Church, a NPS listed site; Lewis Tappan, the anti-slavery philanthropist who funded Plymouth Church; and Gerrit Smith, an upstate stationmaster at another NPS listed site. Samuel and Robert's obituaries confirm their long-term involvement; Samuel's describes him concealing fugitives on his property before driving them to the Long Island Sound to escape by boat. Over 300 years of family and community records in the Archives provide the context for one Quaker family's participation in abolition and the Underground Railroad."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Eliza Parker Escape Site, known historically as €œBelle VueFarm,€is associated with the Underground Railroad because of Eliza's involvementin the Christiana Resistance. Belle Vue Farmis a Georgian-style manor situated on approximately 347 acres in Harford County, Maryland. Between Easter of 1846 and Easter of 1847, Eliza Parker (nÃ©e Eliza Ann Elizabeth Howard), her sister Hannah, mother Cassandra, and two unnamed brothers escaped fromthis imposing ancestral home of the Davis family. Over the five years that followed their escapes, Eliza and her family played a central role in both moral and physical resistance to theincreasingly strict slave laws in the country that eventually led tothe Fugitive SlaveAct of 1850.Eliza met William Parker, another freedom seeker from Maryland who actively assisted African Americans in Pennsylvania evade kidnappings by using armed resistance, if necessary. After marrying, Eliza and William settled in Christiana, Pennsylvania and continued to protect the Black community by working within a network of informants to prevent the kidnapping of free and formerly enslaved persons.Determined to aid freedomseekers, the Parker household stood their ground on September 11th, 1851, when Baltimore County, Maryland slaveholder Edward Gorsuch and his posse attempted to take three of his former bondsmen back south by force. The ensuing skirmish left Gorsuchdead, and culminated in the largest treason trial in U.S. history. Although William Parker escaped to Ontario, Canada, and Eliza was later acquitted and joined him, their act of resistance reverberated irrevocably across the United States."

    "ABSTRACT":"Greenwood Cemetery is an important historic site in the city of Birmingham, and is well maintained and accessible to the public. It is the final resting place of two men with direct historical connections to Michigan's Underground Railroad: George Basil Taylor (c1823-1901) and Deacon Elijah Staunton Fish (1791-1861). Their lives and stories have made a lasting impact on our community. The cemetery is active and contains an estimated 3740 burials.George Taylor fled enslavement in Kentucky in 1855, traveling on foot over 300 miles until reaching Niles, Michigan, where he connected with the Underground Railroad and passage to Canada. He returned and settled in the Birmingham area in 1856. He also was associated with Reverend J.S.T. Milligan, a stationmaster in Southfield, Michigan. George and his wife Eliza (also formerly enslaved) were well known and active in Birmingham, and were the first African Americans to own property in town.Elijah Fish was a pioneer settler who held strong abolitionist views and actively supported freedom seekers politically and financially from the 1830s until his death, co-founding the Oakland County Anti-Slavery Society, bringing anti-slavery lecturers to Birmingham, raising funds and supplies for escapees, and working with abolitionist Henry Bibb to purchase property in Ontario for resettlement of freedom seekers."

    "ABSTRACT":"Santa Rosa Island, a barrier island in northwest Florida, served as a corridor for freedom seekers in the fall of 1864, when an estimated 600 freedom seekers joined United States soldiers on the march back to Fort Pickens and Barrancas on Pensacola Bay. To reach the bay safely, the freedom seekers walked the entire length of Santa Rosa Island. Apart from the U.S. Army's Fort Pickens on the west end and a small recruitment camp on the east end, Santa Rosa Island was an undeveloped and uninhabited barrier island in 1864. The 46 mile long, naturally narrow and low-lying barrier island comprised open beaches, towering dunes, and marshes teeming with wildlife. Today residential and commercial development claims sections of the barrier island while other sections remain public. Gulf Islands National Seashore manages three sections of Santa Rosa Island -- Okaloosa Area on Okaloosa Island, Santa Rosa Area near the midpoint of the island, and the Fort Pickens Area at the westernmost tip of the island. An NPS day or seasonal pass can be purchased at the gate to access the Fort Pickens Area."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Dinsmore Homestead in Burlington, Kentucky, is being nominated as a Site that is associated with the Underground Railroad. Isaac Sanders, an enslaved man owned by James Dinsmore, ran away from the farm in 1853/1854 and was captured and returned by Perry McNeeley, a local patroller. A receipt of the payment Dinsmore made to McNeeley is in our records.Nancy Mcgruder was enslaved on this farm and €œleft€ in September 1865. While freedom was being celebrated elsewhere in the U.S., Kentucky slaves were not legally free until December 1865. She was excluded from the local Baptist Church, along with several other enslaved people who chose not to wait for the final passage of the 13thAmendment.Today the Dinsmore Homestead is an educational museum that contains all original artifacts including a main house, outbuildings, graveyard, and over 90,000 pages of primary source material documenting life in the 19thand early 20thcentury."

    "ABSTRACT":"Augustus Saint-Gaudens' Robert Gould Shaw/54th Massachusetts Regiment Memorial in Boston commemorates one of the first Black regiments in the Civil War. Both the memorial and the regiment it honors have strong connections to the Underground Railroad. Freedom seekers and those that assisted them are represented within the regiment, in its recruiters, and in those that honored their sacrifice with the creation ofthis monument. Though several Black fighting units predated the 54th, the creation of this regiment represented a major turning point in the prosecution of the war and led to the mass mobilization of Black men as soldiers. As the first public monument to commemorate Black soldiers, this memorial symbolizes the beginning of the large-scale inclusion of African Americans in the waging of the Civil War. Through their heroic assault on Fort Wagner, South Carolina, the 54th Regiment, forever enshrined in this beautiful memorial, helped inspire the enlistment of nearly 200,000 African Americans, including many formerly enslaved freedom seekers, into the war effort. This boost in morale and manpower in the final two years of the Civil War proved essential to victory and directly led to the emancipation of millions."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Mackall Plantation, now part of the footprint of St. Mary's College of Maryland, was the site of escape for nineteen enslaved African Americans who self-emancipated by joining Vice Admiral Alexander Cockburn's British fleet during the War of 1812. Members of the Hicks, Mackall, and Brome families enslaved Africans and African Americans on the site from 1753-1864, with John Mackall, Jr. presiding over the property at the time of the escape. On April 2, 1814, Admiral Cockburn issued a proclamation of emancipation for all enslaved Marylanders and their families who would either enlist with the British or agree to settle in British territories. Although primarily a military expediency, the proclamation temporarily broke John Mackall Jr.'s hold over the enslaved people then held on the site. Between April and August of 1814, nineteen enslaved individuals made their way from Mackall's plantation to British lines on nearby St. George's Island, in the Potomac River. After boarding a British warship, some of Mackall's former bondsmen, including Harry Hammett and €œLittle Harry,€ joined Cockburn's newly founded Corps of Colonial Marines. Once the War of 1812 ended in American victory all nineteen freedom seekers settled in Trinidad andNova Scotia. A recent multi-year research effort by St. Mary's College of Maryland revealed that their current athletic fields stand on land that formerly comprised the then-Mackall Plantation. Accordingly, with the dedication of a commemorative installation to enslaved freedom seekers from St. Mary's County in November of 2020, the athletic fields have become the primary point of interpretation and visitation for the plantation site.

    "ABSTRACT":"he Cozad-Bates House Interpretive Center, located in the University Circle neighborhood of Cleveland, Ohio, opened in 2021 to tell the story of this region's role in the Underground Railroad. The center's main exhibit, Finding Hope: Cleveland and the Underground Railroad, sets both the local and national context for the Underground Railroad in the years leading up to the Civil War and highlightsstories of local activists and freedom seekers, while making connections to social justice issues faced today. The exhibits continue outside with an interpretive walkway that focuses on the perilous northward journey of the freedom seekers. A virtual tour offers 24/7 access to the interior exhibits. The Cozad-Bates House is the last remaining structure in University Circle associated with the scattered farmsteads of what wasthen East Cleveland Township, an area with strong abolitionist sentiment that was active on the Underground Railroad. The housewas built in 1853 by Andrew Cozad for his son Justus and later expanded. Though we don't know whether this house was a part of that network, members of the Cozad family and neighbors were verified participants. This house and its public programs shine a light on that era in Cleveland's history."

    "ABSTRACT":"St. Stephen's African Methodist Episcopal Cemetery is the final resting place of 18 soldiers of the United States Colored Troops. Over a third of these men were formally enslaved on the nearby Wye Plantation and secured their emancipation via enlistment in the Union Army in 1863. One of these 18, freedom-seeker Matthew Roberts, escaped from Wye earlier that year, before Union representatives approached his master, Colonel Edward Lloyd, to conduct a mass recruitment at Wye. On his own initiative and making use of his knowledge of the local terrain, Roberts evaded slave catchers, faked his own death, and boarded a ferry to Baltimore, where he enlisted in the 4thUSCT. After the war, Matthew Roberts and his comrades became founding fathers to a thriving Black community mere miles from the site of their former enslavement. St. Stephen's Cemetery, containing both the Unionville 18 and generations of theirdescendants, bears silent witness to their accomplishments in life. Through escape, enlistment, and military service, the Unionville 18 delivered themselves out of slavery and into lives of self-determination. "

    "ABSTRACT":"The Jails at Port Tobacco Courthouse Site is the location of two former structures that imprisoned enslaved freedom seekers. The first jail was built in the early 19th century, before a successor structure was erected in 1860 adjacent to the ruins of the first. Although the site is purely archeological at this time, this location€“including the reconstructed 1819 county courthouse€“formed an integral part of Charles County's infrastructure of oppression during slavery, often described as the €œReverse Underground Railroad.€ One of the most notable prisoners at the site was William Wheeler, an architect of the 1845 Port Tobacco Mass Escape. Documentation confirms that Wheeler, among others, escaped from these jails between 1845 and 1861.On July 8th1845, some 40-70 enslaved residents of Port Tobacco gathered for a coordinated, daylight escape. The group reached Rockville, Maryland, northwest of Washington, D.C., before armed white mobs surrounded and assaulted them. The survivors were distributed tojails across Maryland, and some, including William Wheeler, were imprisoned at the Port Tobacco jail. Wheeler ultimately escaped from the original jail and was never recaptured. However, these remarkable acts of collective resistance and self-determination resulted in acts of retribution against the entire enslaved population of Charles County. "

He and his employee and partner in this work, William Van Rensalier (1834-1904), have strong oral traditions of assistance to freedom seekers that survived in their families' and through the 20thcentury in the Paterson press. By the 1950s, the house was remodeled into a drug store and was demolished in 1983. Through the efforts of Huntoon and Van Rensalier family descendants, who formed the Huntoon-VanRensalier Underground Railroad Foundation,the site was designated a Historic Site by the Paterson Historic Preservation Commission and the City Council of the City of Paterson. The property is now a memorial to these two men as well as the other Underground Railroad operativesand this important aspect of the history of Paterson.The site, now paved and landscaped as part of the inner-city campus of Passaic County College, is also embellished with a monumental bronze by famed African American sculptor, Ed Dwight, depicting the twomen.The application also documents the Underground Railroad network in Paterson in the latter half of the 1850s."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Presbyterian Plane Street Colored Church was built in 1836 (no longer standing) and was located on the current Frederick Douglass Field at Rutgers University in Newark, New Jersey. The church represented the unyielding work of the Newark Black activist community for Black emancipation and as Underground Railroad activists. It exemplified the ways in which free northern Black people helped build the UGRR for freedom seekers as station masters, activists,lecturers and artists, with a national network of Black activists. It was also a school, meeting hall and lecture hall. The Colored Anti -Slavery Society of Newark and the Relief Society, a group that assisted freedom seekers with funds and resources was affiliated with it. It was also the direct connection to an UGRR station operated by the treasurer of the Relief Society, Jacob King, and his home/station only a few feet away.Freedom seekers and the formerly enslaved ministered, taught at the school located there, and worshipped at this church.The church's leadership included many prominent persons connected to the UGRR, including freedom seekers and operatives Samuel Eli Cornish, Junius Morel, Samuel Ringgold Ward,Christopher Rush,and poet Elymas Payson Rogers,writer of the nationally performed A Poem on the Fugitive Slave Law."

    "ABSTRACT":"The LeComte Magnolia Plantation (also known as Magnolia Plantation) is one of two units within Cane River Creole National Historical Park and is located along Cane River about 25 miles south of Natchitoches and three miles west of Cloutierville, Louisiana. Although written documentation is scarce (it is assumed most documentation was burned as the Red River Campaign raged in the area during the Civil War) the plantation is associated with escapes by enslaved African Americans, including the 1804 Insurrection from Riviere aux Cannes (Cane River), during which at least 30 enslaved people left the plantations of Maria Dupre, Alexis Cloutier, Emmanuel Derbanne, Ambroise LeComte (Ambroise I), and Louis Derbanne. These 30 freedom seekers crossed the LeCompte Plantation land enroute to Los Adaes (a nearby Network to Freedom site) and sought freedom in Spanish Texas. The plantation is also associated with an 1863 runaway named Anderson who escaped with two others named Arnold and Alfred from adjacent plantations. During the Civil War, the property was used as a Union Army encampment during the Red River Campaign, but no records of escape have yet been discovered from that time period. The property was one of the largest cotton plantations within Natchitoches Parish and the landowners, the LeComte (also LeCompte) and Hertzog families, were the largest slave-holding families within the region in 1860. Today the site consists of 18 acres with approximately 20 historic structures, including eight original brick slave/tenant cabins and several landscape features. The 18-acre property is half of the historic core of the plantation; the other half of the historic core remains in private ownership by descendants of the original planter family. Historically, Magnolia Plantation incorporated additional landholdings and encompassed adjacent lands spanning just over 2,570 acres (as of 1858). The plantation had nearly five miles of river frontage and stretched back from the river nearly three miles, the result of land acquisition dating back to 1753.  "

It is located along Cane River (Cane River Lake) about 13 miles south of Natchitoches, Louisiana. Although written documentation is scarce, the Emmanuel Prudhomme Plantation is known to be associated with escapes by enslaved African Americans. All documented escapes occurred during the Civil War, most notably the Red River Campaign, as enslaved people left with the Union soldiers as the army moved through the area. In a single day, the plantation lost 11 men, 10 women, and 15 children, which represented over a quarter of the plantation's enslaved population. Edmo, Andrew, Charles, Cesaire, Jules Russel, Sersphine Edmonds, and Collins Page are a few of the named individuals that escaped to freedom during that time. Emmanuel Prudhomme Plantation is an example of an escape site in the Central Louisiana cotton region. The property was one of the largest cotton plantations within Natchitoches Parish and the landowners, the Prudhommes, were one of the largest slave-holding families within the region in 1860. Today the site consists of 45 acres with approximately 40 historic structures, including two original slave/tenant cabins and several landscape features.

It can also be taken as a self-guided walking tour using the map, brochure, and companion reader. This program explores the rich history of the Underground Railroad and the African-American community in Northeastern Pennsylvania with a focus on the abolitionists who aided the runaways on their journey north, while also assisting them in building one of the largest black communities in the region during the 1800's (many of the runaways opted to settle in Waverly due to the assistance provided by abolitionists). The tour begins at the Waverly Community House and makes it way around the building's square, then proceeds north on Abington Road, stopping at the sites that were the homes, schools, churches, and meeting places of 19thcentury abolitionists and runaways.Specific locations include the Fell Schoolhouse, a one-room schoolhouse where runways were educated, and the homes of abolitionists John Raymond, John Fell, and Samuel Kennedy, among others. One of the final stops on the tour includes Carbondale Road, a large stretch of road that became home to one of Northeastern Pennsylvania's largest runaway settlements. "

    "ABSTRACT":"The Jacob Heald Farm, located in the northern Delaware community of Hockessin, was owned by Quaker abolitionist, farmer and teacher, Jacob Heald from 1830 –1856. The community of Hockessin was settled by Quakers in 1726 when Delaware was still part of Pennsylvania. During the time of Jacob Heald’s ownership, Pennsylvania was a free state and Delaware was a slave state and this property was very close to the border. Connections existed within the northern Delaware Quaker religious community of those who actively assisted freedom seekers to cross into free territory and this property was part of that network. Jacob Heald subscribed to abolitionist newspapers, entertained abolitionist speakers at his farmhouse, and voted for free soil candidates. All of Jacob Heald’s obituaries and those of his daughter state that this property was a station on the underground railroad."

Their names are as follows, Benjamin, Calvin, Jacob, and Solomon Denny, Hudson Ferrol, William Henry, Ebenezer McInnis, and George Washington.After escaping from the sawmillthese men were rescued by the USS Calhounduring the civil war and enlisted to fight for the freedoms they and others sought.This Island of 3,155 acres makesfor the perfect location for the freedom seekers mentioned in this application. Wild and untamed it gave them a place to hold up until rescued by the US Navy. All together Horn Island brings to life the stories of the past with it’s almost unchanged landscape. Visible on clear days from the beach and bridges around the city,it is now a destination for campers, outdoor enthusiast, and day visitors for fishing or beach combing. With large sand dunes, maritime forest, and a plethora of wildlife it is the last vestige of wilderness along the Mississippi Gulf Coast."

    "ABSTRACT":"Freedom seekers journeyed to Ship Island in hopes of attaining liberation after the island fell under Union control during the Civil War.  Due to the strong presence of the Union Navy in the waters of the Mississippi Sound and Gulf of Mexico, and the garrisoned fort on the island, Ship Island was considered safe harbor by those enslaved on the Mississippi mainland. While some freedom seekers reached Ship Island’s shores, others were liberated from Confederate blockade runner A.J. View and brought to the island before being transported to other destinations. Robert Morril [sic] was the first recorded freedom seeker to join the Union military. The 3,160 acres on Ship Island are part of National Park Service's Gulf Islands National Seashore."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Dorrington Building, located at 1601 Stone Street in Falls City, Nebraska, was built in 1881 on the site of the home of Davidand Ann Dorrington. The Dorringtons' barn, which sat just behind the small house to the west, was used to harbor freedomseekers traveling the westernmost line of Underground Railroad, which followed the “Jim Lane Trail” used by free-stateemigrants to reach Kansas from Iowa. David began construction on the house in the fall of 1857. He built the large barn soonafter he acquired the federal contract to transport mail between Falls City and Topeka. Dorrington’s mail carriers, whichincluded two of his sons, used mail wagons to transport enslaved peoples out of Kansas to the Dorrington barn, where theyremained through daylight hours under the care of Ann Dorrington until they could safely continue north at night. Many otherfreedom seekers reportedly traveled to Falls City without escort. According to David and Ann's son, William, John Brown sleptin the barn one night during his final trip from Kansas in early 1859. The house was removed in 1881 to make way for theDorrington Building."

    "ABSTRACT":"The John Brown Farm in North Elba, New York, is being listed in the Network to Freedom as the burial place of John Brown and eleven other men who died either at or after the raid on the armory at Harper’s Ferry, Virginia. The farmlandwas purchased fromabolitionist Gerrit Smith and occupied by Mary A. Brown and the younger Brown children from 1849 until 1860. For much of his adult life, John Brown was dedicated to ending slavery in the United States using violent means, and for this he was ultimately hanged by the US government after the raid at Harper’s Ferry, VA. But John Brown had a lifelong connection to providing assistance to freedom seekers. A Calvinist in religious faith,John Brown modeled for his family the equality of all people, and the rest of the family put into practice Brown’s passion for assisting his Black neighbors. The period of ownership and residence at the North Elba farm coincided with long absences by the patriarch. Brown himself only lived here for 6 non-consecutive months.1It was during the period of ownership that Brown went to Kansas with his older sons; leading violent campaigns against pro-slavery forces in the Pottawatomie Massacre in May of 1856 and other violent episodes known collectively as “Bleeding Kansas”andin leading a small group of 18-22 men in the raid on the armory at Harpers Ferry, Virginia in 1859, which was to raise an armed rebellion of the enslaved. He was buried on the property in early December 1859. The cemetery was expanded after the period of the Brown family ownership. Beginning in the 1870s,when the John Brown Association lead by Kate Field purchased the property and allowed pilgrimage and expansion of the burial site to include family members and others killed at Harper’s Ferry."

    "ABSTRACT":"Rev.Beriah Green’s grave lies in Grand View Cemetery, overlooking the Village of Whitesboro. Rev.Beriah Greenbecame president of the Oneida Institute of Science and Industry in Whitesboro, New York, in 1833. It wasAmerica’s first mixed-race college. The faculty and students were dedicated to “immediatism,” the immediate and uncompensated end of slavery. Witness accounts and documentary evidence prove that Rev.Green’s home in the village of Whitesboro was a station on the Underground Railroad, and that Freedom Seekers were also protected by the Institute’s students. Several students were Freedom Seekers themselves, and went on to vigorously spread the abolitionist cause. Rev.Green served as the presiding officerof the American Anti-Slavery Society at its organizational meeting held in Philadelphia in 1833. He also helped organize the New York State Anti-Slavery Society in Utica inOctober 1835 which was disrupted by a violent mob before reconvening at Gerrit Smith’s Peterboro estate. "

Before the Civil War, freedom seekers and their allies mingled on the waterfront among other workers, sailors and ships’ passengers. Freedom seekers sought passage fromPlymouth and their allies passed along information to help them. Newspapers recordfreedom seekers leaving plantations on and near the Roanoke and comingto Plymouthto continuetheir quests for freedom or blend in with local free people of color and find work.Plymouth began as a 17th-century trading poston the Roanoke. A federal customs houseestablishedin 1830 cleared ships to sail directly to any seaport in the world. There was regular maritime traffic between Plymouth and northern cities. Water Street Landing Parkconsists of about one acre on public land and includes a replica of the 1867 Roanoke River Lighthouse.

    "ABSTRACT":"Famed Abolitionist John Brown was born in Torrington, Connecticut in 1800 and moved to Hudson, Ohio with his parents in 1805. He quickly developed a hatred for slavery learned largely from his father, who used the family home as a stop on the Underground Railroad. John Brown’s list of anti-slavery activities is long, but he is most well-known for fighting slave-supporters in Kansas (Bleeding Kansas) and for attempting to lead a slave revolt starting with attacking the arsenal at Harpers Ferry in 1859. This event contributed to the Civil War. John Brown lived in three houses in Richfield and hid slaves in his cellar of his home on West Streetsboro Road. This house, his third in Richfield, is still standing and being nominated for inclusion on the NPS Network to Freedom based on John Brown’s life work in support of freeing enslaved people and its use as an Underground Railroad station in 1843. Eunice Merton, respected Richfield historian and journalist, recorded this event as related by Jennie Oviatt with details from her grandparents, Mason and Jennie Oviatt, confirmed abolitionists. (Their house is currently on the Network to Freedom.) The story tells of Mason’s journey to John Brown’s house (being nominated) and of his picking up and hiding five freedom seekers that he transported in a false bottom wagon to Oberlin, Ohio. "

    "ABSTRACT":"The Barnard family operated an active station on the Underground Railroad in rural Chester County, Pennsylvania. At their farmhouse, built in the early 1800s, Eusebius Barnard served as station master.His wives (Sarah Painter and later Sarah Marsh) and five children (especially Elizabeth, Eusebius R., and Enos) all ministered to the needs of freedom-seekers.As Quakers,abolitionists, and social reformers,they upheld ideals of simplicity, truth, equality, and community. Eusebius and Sarah Marsh Barnard were well-connected local activists, founders of the Pennsylvania Yearly Meeting of Progressive Friends(Longwood). Eusebius also signed the petition for the formation of Pocopson Township.The family hosted their most famous freedom seeker, Harriet Shephard in October of 1855,when she led her five children and five others in their escape from slave owners in Chestertown, Maryland. Harriet testified that she did not want her children to grow up in bondage. The party seized two carriages and horses and by riding all night, covered the fifty miles to Wilmington, Delaware. Assisted by Thomas Garrett, they stopped at Longwood Progressive Meeting House before resting for a few hours at the Barnard station. Young Eusebius R. later guided them to a station in Downingtown. The Shephard family eventually crossed safely into Canada."

    "ABSTRACT":"Belle Grove Plantation in Frederick County, Virginia, relied on the labor of enslaved people. Established in the late 1700s by Isaac Hite Jr. and his wife Nelly Madison, the Hite family enslaved 276 people between 1783 and 1851. On several occasions, those enslaved at Belle Grove took steps to secure their own freedom. Of those enslaved during the Hite period at Belle Grove, 11 are known to have attained freedom. In 1800, a Baltimore newspaper ad sought the return to Belle Grove of a freedom seeker, most likely a man named Primus. A few years later, another newspaper ad states that Daniel had fled the plantation on Easter weekend in 1804, while another freedom seeker, Henry, had fled in late 1805. Another man, Jacob, is known to have fled Belle Grove sometime after 1824. "

    "ABSTRACT":"The Lyles Station History Museum in Gibson County, Indiana is based in an historic African American farming community. The museum was founded by Stanley Madison in 1998 to make known the history and achievements of the African Americans in that region, back to the 1810s. In 2013 the museum began collaborating with Dr. Gardullo and Dr. Cox, co-curators of an exhibit on African American settlers to the antebellum Midwest at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture. This collaboration led to the creation of a permanent exhibit at the NMAAHC on the history of African American farmers in Lyles Station and the Midwest. The Underground Railroad Program at the Lyles Station Museum has been a popular program for over a decade, and consists of a permanent display in the second floor exhibit hall as well as a coordinating educational traveling trunk program for use in public schools. The Underground Railroad program is heavily utilized by schools to fulfill Indiana’s 4th grade Indiana History requirement. The URR exhibit and trunk were recently updated to reflect and interpret the history of two newly established NPS URR Network to Freedom sites in Gibson County. "

    "ABSTRACT":"Other Voices of Freedom (a permanent exhibit), is within a dedicated 600 square foot gallery off of our main gallery.Our interpretations reveal the importance of local waterways in the questfor freedom through 23 individuals’ stories.We focus on the Chesapeake Bay watershed and lower Susquehanna River within Harford, Cecil,and Baltimore Counties, Maryland, and extending north to Columbia, Pennsylvania. We examine the role of the Chesapeake Baywatershed in Maryland’s maritime commerce during the 19thcentury. Enslaved African-Americans were integral to that as many were exploited. Through installations of artworks by contemporary African-American artists in three-dimensional exhibits, we present first-hand narratives interwoven in signage and graphics providing historical, legal, and cultural context. In poignant clarity, heroes of the local abolitionist movement are exhibited alongside 28 informative panels further describing those involved and their contributions to the cause of freedom. Visitors learn about Frederick Douglass’ daring escape through Havre de Grace; William Still’s correspondence with William Whipper, a Black freeman stationmaster; and 12 individuals who overcame difficult circumstances.Several daring escapes by boat and rail bring into focus the importance of local geography. The  darker  sides–the  bounty  hunters,  bloodhounds,  kidnappers,  and  physical bondage –are confronted."

    "ABSTRACT":"The site nominated includes the home site and burial site of Ona Judge Staines after she escaped enslavement by President George and Martha Washington in Philadelphia on May 21,1796, and travelled by ship to Portsmouth, NH, her initial destination. It’s believed she was a ssisted by Richard Allen, a major figure in the Philadelphia Black community, founder of the first national Black church in America, and a chimney sweep who had worked in the Washington’sPhiladelphia household in 1796. Allen was a member of the Free African Society, a mutual aid group for Blacks in Philadelphia. Philadelphia’s free Blacks found passage for Ona on the ship Nancy, captain John Bowles of Portsmouth, NH. She arrived in Portsmouth, NH after five days where she found both a small supportive Black community and associates of George Washington’s. Washington’s emissaries made several attempts to return her, and the last prompted her to leave Portsmouth for sanctuary with free Black Phillis Jack of Greenland, NH. Ona and her husband free Black sailor Jack Staines spent the rest of their lives at this site. Ona Judge Staines died on Feb. 25, 1848 and is believed buried at the Greenland site along with the Jack and Staines families."

    "ABSTRACT":"Cypress Lawn Cemetery in Colma, California, is the burial place of Samuel D. Burris, an Underground Railroad operative who worked in the slave state ofDelaware from 1845-1847. This free person of color from western Kent County was documented in William Still’s 1872 book, “The Underground Railroad” and inthe court records of Kent County, Delaware. Still noted Burris’ assistance to freedom seekers Chester and Samuel Hawkins early December 1845 who were part ofa group of twelve he was conducting from western Maryland to Wilmington, Delaware. Burris was imprisoned in July 1847 for assisting Maria Matthews on anunsuccessful freedom attempt. Her enslaver pressed charges as did two others in separate cases. He was convicted in two of the cases and was to be sold intoslavery by the state. The Pennsylvania Abolition Society raised $500 and purchased him at auction. Burris moved his family to Philadelphia where he served onthe Business Committee of the PAS until 1852 when he and his brothers moved their families to San Francisco. He died there in 1863 and was buried in LaurelHill Cemetery. In 1940 the burials from this cemetery were moved to Cypress Lawn Memorial Park in Colma, California."

    "ABSTRACT":"Fort Frederica National Monument was the setting for several escapes by enslaved individuals, as well as a defensive outpost for a community of freedom seekers who fled to the Union-occupied fort during the Civil War. In 1751, Johann Martin Bolzius wrote that enslaved people often passed Frederica on their route to freedom in Spanish-held Florida. An enslaved girl named Maria escaped from Frederica in 1766 and successfully evaded capture for at least eight months. During the Civil War, Fort Frederica functioned as a defensive outpost for a freed community at the southern portion of St. Simons Island. Freed men occupied this outpost to observe the back channels of St. Simons Island and to deter any attack by Confederate forces on their community. Fort Frederica originally was a British colonial fort and town. The townsite itself is approximately 45 acres and contains the foundations and remains of several 18th century buildings, including homes, businesses, the barracks, and the magazine. Remnants of the earthen walls of the fort also remain. The National Park Service owns 305 acres on St. Simons Island, which includes the 45-acre historic town site, portions of land around the historic townsite as well as one hundred acres of marshland."

    "ABSTRACT":"Israel (1797-1861) and Avis (1796-1882) Blodgett were abolitionists who acted as conductors on the Underground Railroadat their home in Downers Grove, Illinois from the early 1840s to 1861. Various primary source evidence – including first-person accounts from their children, newspaper articles, and local booster publications written in the 19th and early 20thcenturies – detail how Israel and Avis Blodgett provided aid and shelter to freedom seekers at their house. Israel wouldthen transport them secretly to the home of Philo Carpenter in Chicago. A contemporary antislavery newspaper, theWestern Citizen, documents Israel’s involvement in the Liberty and Free Democracy Parties and connections with other localUnderground Railroad participants in the 1840s and 1850. Born in Massachusetts, Israel and Avis Blodgett moved to Illinoisin 1830-1831 and settled in Downers Grove in 1836. They built a historic upright-and-wing Greek Revival House in the1840s or 1850s that became the base of their Underground Railroad operations. Today, the Israel and Avis Blodgett Houseis located near its original location on the Downers Grove Park District Museum campus and has been open to the publicas a historic house museum since 2020.

    "ABSTRACT":"Frederick Douglass—probably the foremost antislavery advocate and conductor along the Underground Railroad—relocatedwith his family to Rochester, New York in 1848 after living in Massachusetts for nine years. His wife Anna Murray-Douglass—herself a free person—was instrumental not only in his escape from bondage, but in also assisting her husband with activitiesrelated to aiding freedom seekers over the course of her life. In fact, in 1852 their family moved into a home located on whatwas then the outskirts of the city at 999 South Avenue. The house was at the top of the hill on South Avenue and with no otherneighbors, which was integral to the work they did assisting freedom seekers.[i] Historians estimate that he assistedsome 400fugitives while in Rochester.[ii] This also took place at a time when there was surge in the number of Black people fleeing toCanada after the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. In fact, about 150 fugitives were funneled through Rochester enroute to Canada each year during the 1850s.[iii] During their twenty-year period[iv] at this residence, Douglass worked onthe North Star (renting an office in the Talman Building at 25 Buffalo Street), maintained a demanding lecture schedule,published the abolitionist journal the Douglass Monthly[v], and recruited for the Union Army. Unfortunately, in 1872 thehome was destroyed in a fire. Today, this site is the location for Anna Murray-Douglass Academy School No.12."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Underground Railroad in Boston is a Self-Guided Audio Tour freely available on the National Park Service App formobile devices. This twelve-stop narrated tour begins in the historically African American neighborhood of Beacon Hill andmakes its way through downtown Boston to Long Wharf on the waterfront. Featuring nuanced interpretation, readings offirst-hand accounts and other primary sources, and an original score inspired by traditional spirituals and folk songs, thistour delves into lesser known stories of the Underground Railroad in Boston. It looks at freedom seekers who came toBoston including William and Ellen Craft, Elizabeth Blakely, and others. It also highlights the individuals, organizations, andinstitutions that assisted freedom seekers along their journey including William Cooper Nell, the Boston VigilanceCommittee, and the Twelfth Baptist Church among others. Further this tour examines the private ways in which peopleparticipated in the Underground Railroad network as well as the larger scale public protests and open confrontations withenslavers, their agents, and government authorities. By elevating these once covert places and stories, this tourencourages exploration and engagement with Boston’s unique role in this inspiring movement and aims to help visitorsfind contemporary relevance in their own lives."

    "ABSTRACT":"The North Country Underground Railroad Historical Association founders, Don and Vivian Papson participated in a Battle ofPlattsburgh parade, they were asked if African Americans had participated in the War of 1812. In researching informationfor this question, they uncovered the story of a local Underground Railroad, which had been documented by Essex CountyRepublican Editor Marjorie Lansing Porter, the great-granddaughter of abolitionist and Underground Railroad conductorWendell Lansing, founder of the Essex County Republican. Other researchers and historians who preserved localinvolvement in the Underground Railroad included Emily McMasters, Addie Shields and Tom Calarco.The Association organized with a Steering Committee and Board of Trustees, which met in the basement of the FirstPresbyterian Church in Plattsburgh. In 2009, renovations started on the former Herbert Estes residence, which became theNorth Star Underground Railroad Museum, located at 1131, Mace Chasm Rd. Ausable Chasm, NY. Supported by the Ausable Chasm Co. and the Town of Chesterfield, the building serves as a museum as well as the Town of ChesterfieldHeritage Center. In 2019, the Ausable Chasm Co. Board and the Town of Chesterfield deeded the building and property tothe Association, which interprets, preserves and exports the history of the “Champlain Line” of the UGRR. The museum’sarchives includes Tom Calarco's extensive UGRR collection on New York state, as well as priceless and one-of-a-kindartifacts such as Stephen Keese Smith's memoirs."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Mount Pleasant Underground Railroad Historic District includes the Mount Pleasant Historic District, a National Historic Landmark, and two houses located just outside the district in the Village of Mount Pleasant. From the 1810s to the 1860s, Mount Pleasant, Ohio was commonly known as a center for abolition activities, a place of refuge for freedom seekers continuing northward, and a welcome place of residence for African-Americans. Predominantly Quaker in population and in conjunction with a large free Black population, Mount Pleasant contained multiple Underground Railroad stops and represented a multi-racial community of people working together to assist freedom seekers. The anti-slavery network in Mount Pleasant included buildings, plus the people who lived there, utilized its resources, or attended the Yearly Meetinghouse. The historic district is comprised of properties that represent this multi-racial network of people, which includes the Ohio Yearly Meeting House where Quakers gathered. The two houses, incorporated in the Mount Pleasant Underground Railroad Historic District for their association in the community effort to support the UGRR, include the Hamlin-Bruce (662 Union Street) and Underwood (87 Mulberry Street) houses, both occupied by free Black families"

    "ABSTRACT":"Archer Alexander, a freedom seeker enslaved in St. Charles, Missouri, was first captured in February 1863 when sixteen men made their attempt for freedom at Howell’s Ferry on the Missouri River. Running for his life, as he had overheard his enslaver Richard Pitman, and other area men, plotting to destroy a vital railroad bridge nearby he had informed the Union Troops. Escaping, he made his way to St. Louis a\nnd the home of an abolitionist named William Greenleaf Eliot, where his enslaver attempted to recapture him. As Missouri was under Marshall law, following a military investigation he was granted freedom,\nby September 24, 1863, through the provisions of Lincoln’s Second Confiscation Act. In 1865, when President Lincoln was assassinated, a fund for a memorial to Lincoln was initiated by Charlotte Scott. The\nWestern Sanitary Commission assisted the formerly enslaved with this and requested the image of the enslaved man be that of Archer Alexander. The Emancipation Memorial was dedicated on April 14, 187\n6, in Washington, DC’s Lincoln Park. December 8, 1880, seventy-four-year-old Archer Alexander passed away, and following a funeral at Washington Metropolitan AME Zion Church was buried in an unmarked grave in St. Peters United Church of Christ Cemetery."

    "ABSTRACT":"In 1846, Bristol Congregational church members issued a bold statement against slavery in their\n“Resolutions on Moral Subjects,” sent for publication to the Chicago Western Citizen, just 10 years after\nthe congregation was formed. One of seven Congregational church societies organized between 1834\nand 1858 in Kendall County, Illinois, charter members maintained close ties with their earlier Bristol Hill\nCongregational Church in Volney, New York, where members were staunch abolitionists, and the\ncongregation was comprised of both black and white members when few churches were integrated. In\nKendall County they held tightly to their core beliefs and became active in the establishment and\nsuccess of the local Underground Railroad (UGRR) long before the church edifice was built in 1855.\nRumored to have later been a hiding place for freedom seekers, the original church cellar is now gone,\nbut research confirms that church members and pastors offered transportation, shelter, clothing, and\nprotection to freedom seekers passing through the area. Together with the neighboring Baptist church\nand other Congregational churches, a cooperative network of support was woven throughout the\ncounty. As the last surviving of those early churches, today’s Chapel on the Green stands as a proud\nlegacy of church and county involvement in the UGRR."

    "ABSTRACT":"Greenwood Cemetery in St. Louis is a crucial vestige of African American history and resistance to enslavement. Historic cemeteries nationwide face growing threats over time, with African American cemeteries like Greenwood being especially vulnerable. Greenwood Cemetery Preservation Association was formed in 2016 to restore the landscape from abuse, vandalism, and overgrown fields and revive the story\nof the cemetery and those interred for its historical and cultural importance. Including Greenwood on the Network to Freedom is crucial because it recognizes its significance as a site deeply connected to the\nstruggle for freedom and equality. Founded in 1874, Greenwood Cemetery was the first non-sectarian cemetery for African Americans in the Saint Louis metropolitan area. Over 50,000 individuals were burie\nd there, including Harriet Robinson Scott, who sued for freedom in the Dred Scott v. Sandford case alongside her husband. Lucy Delaney, a freedom suit petitioner, and Charlton Tandy, a civil rights activist,\nwere vital to the Underground Railroad and abolition. They embody the bravery and resolve of\nthose who fought against enslavement and helped liberate African Americans. Greenwood stands as a\npowerful reminder of the past and a place where the stories of those involved in abolition are honored\nand remembered."

    "ABSTRACT":"Freedom-seekers Henry Hamer (c. 1816 – 1899) and Elizabeth Hamer’s (c. 1824 – 1913) final resting\nplace is the Royal Oak Cemetery, located in Royal Oak, Oakland County, Michigan. Born into chattel\nslavery, they had been brought and sold until they became the property of Henry Bruce, Jr. of Covington,\nKenton County, Kentucky. Covington—a riverfront town on the Ohio River—was located immediately\nsouth of Cincinnati, Ohio. Cincinnati was the epicenter of abolition and Underground Railroad activism.\nOn August 27, 1856, the Hamers self-emancipated and quietly slipped away in the night from their\nenslaver. Elizabeth was pregnant. In September 1856, the Hamers reached Windsor, Ontario, Canada\nWest, and their son Charles Henry Hamer arrived on March 11, 1857. By 1860, the Hamer family had\nreturned to Michigan and settled in Royal Oak Township—a community 15 miles north of Detroit—and\nhad five additional children. The Hamers and members of the Bruce family exchanged letters and their\nstory from slavery to freedom is documented in correspondence. Presently, Hamer descendants still own\na portion of the original homestead of Henry and Elizabeth Hamer; however, the original house and none\nof the farm buildings exist today."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Michigan Central Railroad (MCRR) Third Street Station in Detroit was part of an important transportation route of the Underground Railroad (UGRR).  From 1848 – 1865 the MCRR was a hub for fugitive enslaved Africans and their descendants. Detroit was named “Midnight” and by then was a UGRR gateway to Canada, as well as the abolitionist communities of Southeastern Michigan and the regional focus of the movement.  The location of the MCRR Third Street Station was at the curve of the Detroit River, an international border, which was the closest distance from the riverbank to the riverbank, between Detroit, Michigan, and Canada. Detroit was well known by UGRR operatives as a city where freedom seekers could find safe refuge not only for its proximity to Canada but also for its strong and active abolitionist community.  Freedom seekers used rail, ferry, and stagecoach as a means of transportation to freedom. The site of the MCRR Third Street Station is now occupied in part by City of Detroit property boundaries, which includes the Joe Louis Arena Parking Structure, this is where freedom happened."

[i] The church’s\nfounding pastor was Rev. Robert Thomas Hickman, a freedom seeker from Boone County, Missouri.\nThe church’s other founding members were freedom seekers from Missouri which included his wife\nMinta and their children, Fielding and Adeline Combs, Henry and Charlotte Moffit, John B. and\nElizabeth Trotter, and Giles Crenshaw. In 1863 Robert and his family escaped from Boone County and\nthey and the other freedom seekers arrived in St. Paul on May 6, 1863, and initially housed at Ft.\nSnelling. Based on the documentation of their escape, Rev. Hickman and the freedom seekers called\nthemselves Pilgrims and settled in St. Paul.\nOn November 15, 1866, Pilgrim Baptist Church was formally chartered. The charter members included\nthe Hickman, Combs, Moffit, and Trotter families and Giles Crenshaw. The first church was built in 1870\nin St. Paul but Rev.

    "ABSTRACT":"In the nineteenth century, the Southfield Reformed Presbyterian Church (SRPC), located in Southfield,Michigan, was committed to the slaves’ cause, abolitionism, and aiding enslaved persons on theirjourney to Canada West.\nRev. James Saurin Turretin Milligan (1826 – 1912)\nacknowledged that heand the members of the congregation always assisted freedom-seekers. Self-emancipated Blacks wereconsistently sheltered as individuals or in small and large groups at the SRPC and at Rev. J.S.T.Milligan’s home.\nBy 1800, the RPCNA was the most radical white abolitionist religious denomination inAmerica. The Covenanters were immediatists and advocated the immediate end to chattel slavery andadvocated that enslaved persons had the right to use force to gain their freedom, by any meansnecessary. In 1834, SRPC was organized as a congregation by the Western Presbytery of the ReformedPresbyterian Church of North America (RPCNA), in Southfield Township, Oakland County, MichiganTerritory. Members of the RPCNA, known as Covenanters, established churches in the Midwestdedicated to ending slavery immediately. The Southfield Reformed Presbyterian Church and RPCNAgoals were to eradicate slavery and influence the U.S. government to honor African Americans’ God-given rights to freedom, justice, and equality."

    "ABSTRACT":"Bethel A.M.E. Church, constructed between 1838 and 1841, is the single remaining historic structure marking the thriving black-founded settlement of Springtown which formed on the ooutskirts of the village of Greenwich in Cumberland County. By the final decades of the 18thcentury, Springtown had emerged as a haven where formerly enslaved people from Delaware and Maryland could enter the free State of New Jersey and begin new lives. The presence of a community of engaged Quakers supported Springtown's ability to absorb newcomers. provide jobs and aid those traveling north. From Springtown, many Freedom Seekers moved into the network of black communities developing in South Jersey. Members of Springtown's Bethel A.M.E. congregation are documented as Underground Railroad operatives in primary sources such as Thomas Clement Oliver's interviews with Wilbur H Siebert, Alexander Walker Wayman's memoir and newspaper articles detailing stories of Springtown kidnappings and escapes. Earlier reflections such as Samuel Ringgold Ward's autobiography and published works by members of the Still family confirm Greenwich as a first step on the freedom trail. Bethel A.M.E. Church has long anchored its community, serving as a beacon of freedom and faith, even to this day."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Darby Friends Meeting and School, located at 1017-1019 Main Street in Darby, Delaware County, Pennsylvania is being listed in the Network to Freedom for the role this Quaker community played in the\nlife of freedom seeker and rescued kidnapping victim, Allen Ricketts (c. 1820-1910). After taking his freedom with other family members from their enslaver near Baltimore, MD at age 11 in the early 1830s, his well-documented story chronicles the outcome of the values of the community as displayed in his finding safe harbor among them, his education at the Darby Friends School, and the support the Darby Quakers provided to rescue him from a later kidnapping. The Darby Quaker community had a long tradition of advocacy for anti-slavery causes and was home to many operatives in Underground Railroad work. Allen Ricketts stands out among many because his story speaks both to the UGRR & the reverse UGRR, and the key part his education and local community support played in his release from kidnapping.\nAllen Ricketts lived and prospered in Darby for the remainder of his life, and was a respected and revered member of the community at his death at 91"

    "ABSTRACT":"Hosanna A.U.M.P. Church and cemetery are surviving monuments to the 19 century village of\nHinsonville (now Lincoln University, PA) that was settled by free and determined to be free Black\nAmericans who were landowners and laborers, and directly involved in major social movements that\ntransformed our country: the Underground Railroad and abolition of slavery; the founding of Ashmun\ninstitute (renamed Lincoln University in 1866 to honor the Emancipator President Abraham Lincoln);\nand the Civil War during which 18 Hinsonville men enlisted in the Union army where their combat roles\ntransformed them into agents of emancipation. The congregation built their first church at this site in\n1843, just 5 miles from the Maryland border where slavery was legal prior to 1865. Hosanna hosted\nabolitionist meetings, and its members operated within an extensive, interracial network of pro-freedom activists. Worship services provided sanctuary for freedom seekers while members like\nThomas Fitzgerald sheltered and fed freedom seekers at his property across the road from Hosanna.\nChartered in 1854, Ashmun Institute was cofounded and supported by Hosanna members who are\nacknowledged Chester County Underground Railroad agents. Some church members, along with\nnumerous Ashmun/Lincoln students, joined the 200,000 United States Colored Troops to reunify the\ncountry and liberate 4 million Americans from slavery"

    "ABSTRACT":"The International Underground Railroad Project seeks to identify and document stories of self liberation across the Americas as told by freedom seekers and their descendants. Using the United States National Committee of ICOMOS’s network of heritage professionals, researchers, historians, geographers, and interested parties across the world, and our partners at the NPS Network to Freedom Project, we work to highlight these stories of the universal desire for freedom. The International Underground Railroad Project and its participatory history efforts raise awareness of and ensure access to the history and legacy of the Underground Railroad’s routes to self-liberation. Unlike other initiatives which focus on the domestic impact of the Underground Railroad, our project concentrates on its international reach and impact. Through bibliographic study, public participation, and field-research, we have collected information about the Underground Railroad’s routes to Canada, the Dutch colonies, Brazil, and Mexico, the experiences of those who traveled along these routes, and the legacy of descendant communities. In collaboration with various stakeholders, we have ensured public access to this information through webinars and the publication of a digital Story Map. In doing so, the voices of descendant communities take center stage as we share their stories and the stories of their ancestors."

Curtis wrote a story entitled \"A Case of Whooping Cough\" that was published in a Quaker children's magazine in\n1934 and republished in 1941 in a book called Stories of the Underground Railroad. It told of a family of fugitive slaves given\nrefuge by James C. and Amelia Jackson at their farmhouse in Hockessin, Delaware in July, 1853. The story was told to Curtis\nby the Jacksons' daughter. The Jacksons were raised as Quakers and attended Hockessin Friends Meeting. They were\nabolitionists who participated in the Longwood Progressive Meeting. The home still stands along the Lancaster Pike in\nHockessin."

    "ABSTRACT":"The people for whom Malone’s Methodist Episcopal Church in Madison, Dorchester County, Maryland, served\nwhen the congregation was first founded in 1864, had spent their lives building a community rich in faith,\nkinship, and the pursuit of freedom—most famously, perhaps, for Harriet Ross Tubman and her family, for her\nconfidant and Underground Railroad agent Jacob Jackson, and freedom seeker Vincent Green. The community\nhelped protect Tubman, Jackson, and Green, who represent the remarkable resiliency, tenacity, and strength of\nfamily, faith, and community during the slavery era. The church, though now closed, continues to serve as a\nplace of memory and legacy for the descendant families rooted here, who are honored to maintain the physical\nsite and celebrate their historical social, cultural, and faith foundations that nurtured the pursuit of and fight for\nfreedom. Their ancestors and loved ones are buried in the church graveyard—some with grave markers, some in\nunmarked graves. Freedom seeker Vincent Green was an original founder of Malone’s. In 1827, Green fled his\nenslaver, but was captured and eventually sold to unknown buyers far away in Baltimore. Remarkably, in 1845,\nGreen returned a free man and became a leader in the community and this church."

This Network to Freedom site represents a shared\nhistory between Florida and Andros Island in the Bahamas. Freedom seekers used the underground\nrailroad to first escape from their enslavers in the U.S., then in combination with the Seminole Indians\nescaped the Florida slave raids in 1821, to freedom in Andros.\nThe program includes cultural workshops and a 3-day festival at the Angola Maroon Community NTF\nsite. It brings together descendants, historians, archaeologists, and community leaders to tell the story\nof the resilient people that once made the site their home. The festival is a homecoming event,\nhonoring the traditions of the ancestors, retelling the history of the site and celebrating the\ndescendants. The annual festival is held in October and features workshops on the traditional basket\nweaving and wood carving traditions that continues today in Andros. A series of Bahamian Junkanoo\nworkshops will also be held weeks prior to the festival, celebrating freedom in dance, costume and\nmusic."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Salem Chapel, British Methodist Episcopal Church (BMEC) which in 1855 is being nominated. This former African Methodist\n\nEpiscopal Church (AMEC) was built by African American freedom seekers who escaped from enslavement by way of the\n\nUnderground Railroad (UGRR). On its opening day, the church was “dedicated to the Service of Almighty God” by Bishop Daniel\n\nAlexander Payne of the AMEC. During the height of the UGRR movement the Salem Chapel welcomed newly arriving freedom\n\nseekers and served as a meeting house where anti-slavery lectures and civil rights activities were held. The most celebrated member\n\nof the Salem Chapel is the legendary UGRR conductor, Harriet Tubman. After the US government passed the 1850 Fugitive Slave\n\nAct, she extended her UGRR route to St. Catharines and worshipped at the Salem Chapel. In 1868, when Tubman was interviewed\n\nby her biographer Sarah Bradford she said, “I wouldn't trust Uncle Sam with my people no longer; I brought them all clear off to\n\nCanada.”"

    "ABSTRACT":"Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve is a 46,000 acre park in Jacksonville, Florida, that held multiple plantations during the Spanish, English, and American periods. These plantation sites, which include Kingsley Plantation, Houston Plantation on Big Talbot Island, and Fitzpatrick Plantation at Cedar Point, were sites of bondage and of escape. In addition, the park’s natural resources include thousands of acres of waterways including portions of the St. Johns and Nassau rivers. These water corridors were the route people traveled in their effort to find freedom.  Due to the broad geographic area of the park and the complex history, the park is able to tell several different stories about freedom seekers, including the accounts of the carpenters and coopers of St. Johns Town in the British period, the Guerrero survivors in 1829, Charles and Dorcas in 1835, Romeo Murray in 1843, James and Pattie during the Civil War and others who sought liberty from various locations within Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve."

    "ABSTRACT":"During the Civil War, the Contraband Camp in Cairo, Illinois, served as a destination and doorway for thousands of freedom seekers who escaped enslavement from 1861 to 1865. Nestled in the delta at the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, freedom seekers had historically seen the river town as a staging point to acquire their freedom further north.  As the Civil War intensified, migration to Cairo came by escape through the Underground Railroad, by military contraband camps, or on the contraband train after the battle of Shiloh.  The contraband camp served as a military recruitment center for freedom seekers to enlist with the U.S. army and for others to find paid jobs to support their family. By 1863, the Contraband Camp established housing, a hospital and school to support thousands of refugees who sought freedom during the war.  The camp at Cairo activated the work of many abolitionists, including Marie Renfro and Laura Haviland, as well and the collaboration the African Methodist Church to provide support of the overwhelming numbers of refugees. Although very little remains of the contraband camp that was a beacon of freedom for so many refugees during the Civil War, the site of the camp remains a landmark that commemorates the lives of thousands of freedom seekers making a way out of no way."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Union Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church is a living testament to the courage and resilience of those who fought against the injustice of bondage in the slave state of Maryland. Constructed in 1871, the church bears witness to its roots, which are traced back to the 1850s. In that tumultuous period, \"Uncle Perry Hinson\" erected a small structure in a secluded woods beyond the town for free and enslaved people. This modest sanctuary served as a refuge for worship, education, fellowship, and the pursuit of equality. As the only place where Black people could gather locally, faith and kinship aided freedom seekers such as Edward Richardson. This haven had unparalleled significance in southern Cecil County, where 35 percent of the population were people of color, nearly half of whom were enslaved. Despite facing violence and opposition from White patrols in the antebellum period and later \"Klu Kluxers\" in the immediate post-war years, worshippers persisted in defying chattel slavery. Today, Union Bethel's origins are deeply rooted in this antebellum era, characterized by defiant resistance, its foundation beginning with the little sanctuary tucked away in the woods."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Genealogy & Local History Department of the Lawrenceburg Public Library District specializes in compiling Dearborn County's past and its role in the resistance to enslavement through escape and flight.  Situated in Southeast Indiana along the Ohio River and connecting to both the Kentucky and Ohio borders, the city of Lawrenceburg and Dearborn County were key locations on the route of the Underground Railroad (UGRR) and later became a community where former slaves and their families settled after emancipation. As a result, information documenting the African American experience is interwoven within our collection.  As our department moves forward, we will continue facilitating research to verify and document sites associated with the UGRR.    Established in 1984 in historic downtown Lawrenceburg, the department's mission is to collect, preserve, educate, and stimulate interest in genealogical and local history research. Our department has access to several primary resources including newspapers, church records, probate documents, city directories, and other primary sources that verify UGRR activities in the area.  We offer research assistance, create engaging programing and content to educate and increase awareness of obscure historical and mission-driven topics, and pursue continuous development of our collection of digital, archival, and print materials."

    "ABSTRACT":"After a decorated career that included a major victory in the War of 1812, Gen. Daniel Bissell retired to his Missouri estate, which he called Franklinville Farm. Bissell's estate grew to include 2,300 acres and one of the largest enslaved workforces in the region. Many of those enslaved on the property are known to have sought freedom, but only a few of their names -- Joseph Blake, Frederick Sams, Charles, John, and Lucy -- are known today. Five generations of the Bissell family lived on the property until it was donated to St. Louis County in 1961. The house was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 and is now a museum that tells the story of those enslaved there through the \"Seeking Freedom\" program."

    "ABSTRACT":"Oglesby Park which is owned and operated by St. Charles County Parks and Recreation, honors the story of Benjamin Oglesby, a man born into enslavement who self-emancipated in 1864. Oglesby joined the Union Army in St. Charles, Missouri, and was sent to Benton Barracks in St. Louis for induction and training. He was assigned to the 56th USCT in Arkansas on garrison duty until the end of the war. Oglesby and his wife Martha, a woman of color who also survived enslavement in Missouri with her children, purchased the property that now encompasses most of the park in 1871. Despite the continual obstacles placed before them by the Jim Crow laws of the 19th century, Benjamin and Martha Oglesby operated a small, yet successful farm, and raised six children in a community of newly freed Black Americans. Oglesby Park, representing the destination site of one Black family, and the story of the Oglesby family provide a place for the public to hear a narrative of resistance to day-to-day oppression and undaunting courage in the face of personal danger."

    "ABSTRACT":"Established in 1871, Smith Chapel Cemetery is an African American burying ground established by nine formerly enslaved individuals in St. Charles County Missouri. At least three men were freedom seekers, and members of the Smith Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church associated with this graveyard. The cemetery is final resting place for Smith Ball (1833-1912), Benjamin Oglesby (1825-1901), and Martin Boyd (1826-1912) who each took steps toward freedom and joined the United States Colored Troops, despite the risks involved for themselves and their families. Living in a border state, these families were caught between the conflict of both Union Troops and Confederate guerilla soldiers. Under Martial law, many Missourians strongly opposed the formation of Colored Troops, only allowing those enslaved to serve as substitutes in their place and to fill County quotas. These freedom seekers, like many others, escaped slavery by the underground railroad, enlisting without permission. Slave Patrols, who kept constant watch of the roads for those attempting freedom, would either return those seeking their freedom to their former enslaver or enforce methods of punishment, which could include death. After the war, these men returned to their families to join others in creating this community."

Green described his 1846 recapture on Post St. and subsequent return to enslavement. John Thomas escaped enslavement from Baltimore Carmelite nuns. He made his way to Post Street’s Black barber William Johnson, who took him to the “station” of abolitionist Wesley Bailey. Johnson settled in nearby Paris Green with 6 other freedom seekers. A New York Times article reported that a group of freedom seekers had passed through Post Street. Oneida Institute student and freedom seeker Jermain Loguen risked capture when visiting Post Street’s Black anti-slavery and religious gatherings. James Fountain was himself vulnerable to recapture when he tried to persuade an enslaved woman to escape."

    "ABSTRACT":"Located along Old Philadelphia Pike (PA Route 340) between Lancaster and Philadelphia, in Bird in Hand, Pennsylvania, the Lampeter Friends Meeting House and Graveyard was established in 1728.  It is the burial site of Daniel and Hannah Gibbons, and their son Dr. Joseph Gibbons, well-documented Underground Railroad operatives whose work is best documented between 1820 and the Civil War. Their farm, located just north of the meeting house, was used to support freedom seekers on their journey, many arriving from the west, handed along from Columbia and Lancaster, Pennsylvania and sent along toward Philadelphia.  Part of a larger community of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), the Lampeter Friends Meeting House was a place for connection with others working toward similar interests and goals.  The site contains a brick one-room meeting house built in 1889 that replaced the earlier building destroyed by fire, a hewn stone carriage mounting block, and a burial ground bounded by a masonry wall.  The associated school survives but is no longer the property of the meeting.  Although there are headstones for the Gibbons family, few graves in the burial ground are marked, reflecting early Quaker burial tradition."

    "ABSTRACT":"Mission San Jose y San Miguel de Aguayo (hereafter Mission San Jose) in San Antonio, Texas is associated with at least two documented stories of freedom seeking and allied resistance to slavery during 1833 and 1859. In 1833, while located within the country of Mexico at the time, Mission San Jose was a site of conflict between the Mexican Army and slave catchers. The Mexican Army ambushed and fired upon slave catchers at Mission San Jose. The slave catchers were hoping to kidnap and re-enslave freedom seekers from Louisiana who were thought to be in the area. The slave catchers were then imprisoned in the nearby jail. Later in 1859, following the annexation of Texas when San Antonio was a part of the United States, Mission San Jose was identified by an enslaver as a potential stopping site of freedom seekers recently escaping his nearby plantation. He identified the Mission San Jose community as a potential source of support. These stories could indicate a deeper history of Underground Railroad activity at the Mission among the mission community and associated religious orders."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Jackson Ranch, founded in 1857 along the US-Mexico border, was a known location of Underground Railroad-like traffic as well as a destination site for settlement for self-emancipators who, according to Jackson family oral tradition, sought respite and assistance on their quest for freedom in Mexico. The Jacksons were a mixed-race family that journeyed 900+ miles overland from Alabama in search of a peaceful life, far from discrimination and marginalization. Led by Nathaniel Jackson, a white farmer, and his life partner Matilda Hicks, a formerly enslaved black woman, this caravan included their mixed-race children, grandchildren, and extended family members in search of a new life along the newly established international border. After purchasing over a league of land adjacent to an existing ferry landing, Nathaniel Jackson established a Methodist congregation on the property that included family cemeteries. The church currently standing on this site functioned as a continuance of the Jackson family’s original faith and was awarded a Texas Historical Commission marker in 1983. The family graveyard at the site includes burials of original Jackson caravan members such as Martin Jackson (b.1837/d.1913) and Columbus Jackson (b.1830/d.1896), who, as children of Nathaniel and Matilda, assisted freedom seekers at the Jackson Ranch."

    "ABSTRACT":"Button Farm Living History Center is a twenty-year project of the Menare Foundation, a nonprofit preserving the legacy of the Underground Railroad. The farm was established to provide a public venue to understand and interpret the important historical connection between enslavement and the pathways to freedom so active in Montgomery County, Maryland.\n\nThe Button Farm Almanac Tour is an interactive exploration of this former plantation landscape, located on 40-acres inside Seneca Creek State Park in Germantown, Maryland. The tour is a sampling of elements from the longer-form educational and hands-on history programs offered onsite, providing participants with a snapshot of the farm’s mission, history and unique interpretive approach.\n\nThough few physical traces remain of the people enslaved at Button Farm—except for a suspected slave cemetery and the natural environment itself—the tour uses 19th century artifacts, architecture and agriculture, alongside newly discovered historical accounts, to illuminate the story of freedom seekers and the impact that they had on local enslaved communities and the abolitionist movement at large. While Button Farm was not a stop on the Underground Railroad, its landscape and surviving cultural resources help to visualize an active corridor of escape that ran through the surrounding community."

    "ABSTRACT":"Lila, the Life of a Missouri slave is costumed first person portrayal of an enslaved woman. Her story begins on the hot summer morning as a young child, is sold away from her parents, sold three times in a span of years, has her children sold away one day as she was in the field. Her story is a universal story as it happened many times over to countless individuals. In the portrayal, she tells her story with a physicality and nervous movements. She sometimes uses humor as she lets you in on secrets from her enslaver. Some of the incidents she recalls, you laugh and cry with her in pain. This constructed life is mined from slave narratives of many different sources.\n\nLila is smart, a survivor, she makes a world with what she needs with courage, intelligence and cunning, all while the idea of freedom is in the upper part of her mind. As her narrative unwinds, she manifests agency in freeing herself. She doesn’t know where freedom is or how long it will take to get there, but she know what happens if she can’t make it and yet she stands waiting on a boat to cross the river to freedom."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Cataract House was one of the busiest Underground Railroad stations on the US-Canadian border. Directed by head waiter John W. Morrison, the hotel’s all-Black waitstaff assisted hundreds of freedom seekers before the American Civil War. Both African Americans and African Canadians were employed seasonally at the Cataract. Many of them were born in Southern states. Some freedom seekers who fled via the Cataract House were enslaved by Southern hotel guests. Others were African American refugees who reached the “fluid frontier” of the Great Lakes Basin and needed help crossing to free soil. They were transported across the Niagara River by ferry, or in small boats rowed by Cataract House waiters, including Morrison himself. After the Suspension Bridge opened to rail traffic in 1855, they also traveled by train. Reaching the Canadian side, freedom seekers were protected by African Canadians, who sent them on to places of greater security and more employment. Such Underground Railroad operations continued for more than two decades, despite a series of sensational rescues that took place. Exemplary of Black agency and resistance, Underground Railroad activism at the Cataract House Site also demonstrates the binational character of antislavery operations in the Niagara River borderlands."

    "ABSTRACT":"The Ohio Freedom Path app is an audio guide that uses the route of the Ohio to Erie Trail to showcase Ohio’s important Underground Railroad (UGRR) and abolition history. The Ohio to Erie Trail is a 326-mile collection of walking and biking trails extending from the Ohio River to Lake Erie. Our mission is to engage listeners with compelling stories of freedom seekers and their allies and to encourage users to put their own feet in the path of this remarkable legacy. Ohio Freedom Path, which is available for free on Google Play and the App Store, shares the history of the 15 counties that the Ohio to Erie Trail passes through. County-specific material is supplemented by excerpts from speeches, poems, memoirs, letters and newspaper accounts, read by a diverse mix of community members. Many sites highlighted on the app are also Network to Freedom sites. In addition, the app features more modern-day reflections on the UGRR, including an interview with Joan Southgate about her walk across Ohio in 2002 at age 73; an interview with Kathy Schulz, author of the 2023 book The Underground Railroad in Ohio; and an interview with a descendant of freedom seeker Addison White."
